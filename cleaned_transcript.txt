the following is a conversation with demus hasabis ceo and co-founder of deepmind a company that has published and builds some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems in the history of computing including alfred zero that learned all by itself to play the game of gold better than any human in the world and alpha fold two that solved protein folding both tasks considered nearly impossible for a very long time demus is widely considered to be one of the most brilliant and impactful humans in the history of artificial intelligence and science and engineering in general this was truly an honor and a pleasure for me to finally sit down with him for this conversation and i'm sure we will talk many times again in the future this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's demis hassabis let's start with a bit of a personal question am i an ai program you wrote to interview people until i get good enough to interview you well i'll be impressed if if you were i'd be impressed by myself if you were i don't think we're quite up to that yet but uh maybe you're from the future lex if you did would you tell me is that is that a good thing to tell a language model that's tasked with interviewing that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in a kind of meta turing test uh probably probably it would be a good idea not to tell you so it doesn't change your behavior right this is a kind of heisenberg uncertainty principle situation if i told you you behave differently yeah maybe that's what's happening with us of course this is a benchmark from the future where they replay 2022 as a year before ais were good enough yet and now we want to see is it going to pass exactly if i was such a program would you be able to tell do you think so to the touring test question you've talked about the benchmark for solving intelligence what would be the impressive thing you've talked about winning a nobel prize in a system winning a nobel prize but i still return to the touring test as a compelling test the spirit of the touring test is a compelling test yeah the turing test of course it's been unbelievably influential and turing's one of my all-time heroes but i think if you look back at the 1950 papers original paper and read the original you'll see i don't think he meant it to be a rigorous formal test i think it was more like a thought experiment almost a bit of philosophy he was writing if you look at the style of the paper and you can see he didn't specify it very rigorously so for example he didn't specify the knowledge that the expert or judge would have um not you know how much time would they have to investigate this so these important parameters if you were gonna make it uh a true sort of formal test um and you know some by some measures people claimed the turing test passed several you know a decade ago i remember someone claiming that with a with a kind of very bog standard normal uh logic model um because they pretended it was a it was a kid so the the judges thought that the machine you know was was a was a child so um that would be very different from an expert ai person uh interrogating a machine and knowing how it was built and so on so i think um you know we should probably move away from that as a formal test and move more towards a general test where we test the ai capabilities on a range of tasks and see if it reaches human level or above performance on maybe thousands perhaps even millions of tasks eventually and cover the entire sort of cognitive space so i think for its time it was an amazing thought experiment and also 1950s obviously it was barely the dawn of the computer age so of course he only thought about text and now um we have a lot more different inputs so yeah maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability so across multiple tasks but i think it's also possible as as systems like god show that eventually that might map right back to language so you might be able to demonstrate your ability to generalize across tasks by then communicating your ability to generalize across tasks which is kind of what we do through conversation anyway when we jump around ultimately what's in there in that conversation is not just you moving around knowledge it's you moving around like these entirely different modalities of understanding that ultimately map to your ability to to uh operate successfully in all these domains which you can think of as tasks yeah i think certainly we as humans use language as our main generalization communication tool so i think we end up thinking in language and expressing our solutions in language um so it's going to be very powerful uh uh mode in which to uh explain you know the system to explain what it's doing um but i don't think it's the only uh uh modality that matters so i think there's gonna be a lot of you know there's there's a lot of different ways to express uh capabilities uh other than just language yeah visual robotics body language um yeah action is the interactive aspect of all that that's all part of it but what's interesting with gato is that it's a it's it's it's sort of pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like you know mapping arbitrary sequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen next so prediction seems to be fundamental to intelligence and what you're predicting doesn't so much matter yeah it seems like you can generalize that quite well so obviously language models predict the next word um gato predicts potentially any uh action or any token uh and it's just the beginning really it's our most general agent one could call it so far but um you know that itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far obviously we're in the in the middle of doing that but the big part of solving agi is creating benchmarks that help us get closer and closer sort of creating benchmarks that test the journalizability and it's just still interesting that this fella alan turing was one of the first and probably still one of the only people that was trying maybe philosophically but was trying to formulate a benchmark that could be followed it is even though it's it's fuzzy it's still sufficiently rigorous to where you can run that test and i still think something like the touring test will at the end of the day be the thing that truly impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend who's an ai system for that friend to be a good friend they're going to have to be able to uh play starcraft and they're going to have to do all of these tasks um get you a beer so the robotics tasks uh play games with you use language humor all those kinds of things but that ultimately can boil down to language it feels like not in terms of the ai community but in terms of the actual impact of general intelligence on the world it feels like language will be the place where it truly shines i think so because it's such an important kind of input output for us i think you're right i think the turing test that what the the kind of the the philosophy behind it which is the idea of can can a machine mimic the behaviors of a human and men and i would say wider than just language and text then you know in terms of actions and everything else creativity all these things then um if it can sort of match or exceed human cognitive capabilities then i think we have a you know true intelligence so i thought from that perspective you're right i think he did formulate the right uh kind of uh setup i just i think there'll be a kind of humor in the ai systems of the future looking back to this conversation and thinking about the touring test and uh also thinking about by that time they would know which year they were finally able to sort of cross the threshold of human level intelligence and think how funny it is that we humans were still confused about this whole problem that has been long ago been solved well hello to the ai agents of the future anyway so going back to your to your journey when did you fall in love with programming first well it's pretty uh pretty young age actually so um you know i started off uh actually games was my first love so starting to play chess when i was around four years old and then um it was actually with winnings from a chess competition that i managed to buy my first chess computer when i was about eight years old it was a zx spectrum which was hugely popular in the uk at the time and uh it's amazing machine because i think it trained a whole generation of programmers in the uk because it was so accessible you know you literally switched it on and there was the basic prompt and you could just get going and um my parents didn't really know anything about computers so but because it was my money from a chess competition i could i could say i i wanted to buy it uh and then you know i just went to bookstores got books on programming and um started typing in you know the programming code and and then of course um once you start doing that you start adjusting it and then making your own games and that's when i fell in love with computers and realized that they were a very magical device um in a way i kind of i would have been able to explain this at the time but i felt that they were sort of almost a magical extension of your mind i always had this feeling and i've always loved this about computers that you can set them off doing something some task for you you can go to sleep come back the next day and it's solved um you know that feels magical to me so i mean all machines do that to some extent they all enhance our natural capabilities obviously cars make us allow us to move faster than we can run but this was a machine to extend the mind and and then of course ai is the ultimate expression of what a machine may be able to do or learn so very naturally for me that thought extended into into ai quite quickly remember the the programming language that was first started special to the machine no it was just the base it was just i think it was just basic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know what specific form it was and then later on i got a commodore amiga which uh was a fantastic machine no you're just showing off so yeah well lots of my friends had atari st's and i i managed to get amigas it was a bit more powerful and uh and that was incredible and used to do um programming in assembler and and uh also amos basic this this specific form of basic it was incredible actually as well all my coding skills and when did you fall in love with ai so when did you first start to gain an understanding that you can not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep but something that's a keen to bringing an entity to life sort of a thing that can figure out something more complicated than uh than a simple mathematical operation yeah so there was a few stages for me all while i was very young so first of all as i was trying to improve at playing chess i was captaining various england junior chess teams and at the time when i was about you know maybe 10 11 years old i was gonna become a professional chess player that was my first thought um that dream was there sure she tried to get to the highest level yeah so i was um you know i got to when i was about 12 years old i got to master stand and i was second highest rated player in the world to judith polgar who obviously ended up being an amazing chess player and uh world women's champion and when i was trying to improve at chess where you know what you do is you obviously first of all you're trying to improve your own thinking processes so that leads you to thinking about thinking how is your brain coming up with these ideas why is it making mistakes how can you how can you improve that thought process but the second thing is that you it was just the beginning this was like in the in the early 80s mid 80s of chess computers if you remember they were physical boards like the one we have in front of us and you pressed down the you know the squares and i think kasparov had a branded version of it that i i i got and um you were you know used to they're not as strong as they are today but they were they were pretty strong and you used to practice against them um to try and improve your openings and other things and so i remember i think i probably got my first one i was around 11 or 12. and i remember thinking um this is amazing you know how how has someone programmed uh uh this this chess board to play chess uh and uh it was very formative book i bought which was called the chess computer handbook by david levy which came out in 1984 or something so i must have got it when i was about 11 12 and it explained fully how these chess programs were made i remember my first ai program being uh programming my amiga it couldn't it wasn't powerful enough to play chess i couldn't write a whole chess program but i wrote a program for it to play othello reversey it's sometimes called i think in the u.s and so a slightly simpler game than chess but i used all of the principles that chess programs had alpha beta search all of that and that was my first ai program i remember that very well was around 12 years old so that that that brought me into ai and then the second part was later on uh when i was around 1617 and i was writing games professionally designing games uh writing a game called theme park which um had ai as a core gameplay component as part of the simulation um and it sold you know millions of copies around the world and people loved the way that the ai even though it was relatively simple by today's ai standards um was was reacting to the way you as the player played it so it was called a sandbox game so it's one of the first types of games like that along with simcity and it meant that every game you played was unique is there something you could say just on a small tangent about really impressive ai from a game design human enjoyment perspective really impressive ai that you've seen in games and maybe what does it take to create ai system and how hard of a problem is that so a million questions just as a brief tangent well look i think um games uh games have been significant in my life for three reasons so first of all to to i was playing them and training myself on games when i was a kid then i went through a phase of designing games and writing ai4 games so all the games i i professionally wrote uh had ai as a core component and that was mostly in the in the 90s and the reason i was doing that in games industry was at the time the games industry i think was the cutting edge of technology so whether it was graphics with people like john carmack and quake and those kind of things or ai i think actually all the action was going on in games and and we've seen we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like gpus which you know i find ironic was obviously invented for graphics computer graphics but then turns out to be amazingly useful for ai it just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication it appears you know in the whole world so um so i think games at the time had the most cutting edge ai and a lot of the the games uh uh we you know i was involved in writing so there was a game called black and white which was one game i was involved with in the early stages of which i still think is the most um impressive uh example of reinforcement learning in a computer game so in that game you know you trained a little pet animal uh and yeah and it sort of learned from how you were treating it so if you treated it badly then it became mean yeah and then it would be mean to to your villagers and your and your population the sort of uh the little tribe that you were running uh but if you were kind to it then it would be kind and people were fascinated by how that was and so was i to be honest with the way it kind of developed and um especially the mapping to good and evil yeah it made you made you realize made me realize that you can sort of in the way in the choices you make can define uh the where you end up and that means all of us are capable of the good uh evil it all matters in uh the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make it's fascinating i mean games can do that philosophically to you and it's rare it seems rare yeah well games are i think a unique medium because um you as the player you're not just passively consuming the the entertainment right you're actually actively involved as an as a as an agent so i think that's what makes it in some ways can be more visceral than other other mediums like you know films and books so the second so that was you know designing ai and games and then the third use uh uh i've we've used of ai is in deep mind from the beginning which is using games as a testing ground for proving out ai algorithms and developing ai algorithms and that was a that was a sort of um a core component of our vision at the start of deepmind was that we would use games very heavily uh as our main testing ground certainly to begin with um because it's super efficient to use games and also you know it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements and because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand there's already a strong set of rules like it's already a damn good benchmark yes it's really good for so many reasons because you've got you've got you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things and in some cases like go we've been playing it for thousands of years um and and uh often they have scores or at least win conditions so it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward it's very easy to specify what that reward is um and uh also at the end it's easy to you know to test uh externally you know how strong is your system by of course playing against you know the world's strongest players at those games so it's it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run potentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud so um i think there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in you know starting out 2010 how come we were able to progress so quickly because we'd utilize games and um you know at the beginning of deep mind we also hired some amazing game engineers uh who i knew from my previous uh lives in the games industry and uh and that helped to bootstrap us very quickly and plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical level of man versus machine over over a chessboard or a go board and especially given that the entire history of ai is defined by people saying it's going to be impossible to make a machine that beats a human being in chess and then once that happened people were certain when i was coming up in ai that go is not a game that could be solved because of the combinatorial complexity it's just too it's it's it's you know no matter how much moore's law you have compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of go yeah and so that then there's something compelling about facing sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the ai researcher perspective engineer perspective and then as a human being just observing this whole thing your beliefs about what you thought was impossible being broken apart it's it's uh humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought it's humbling to realize that the things we think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future there's something really powerful about a game ai system being a human being in a game that drives that message uh home for like millions billions of people especially in the case of go sure well look i think it's a i mean it has been a fascinating journey and and especially as i i think about it from i can understand it from both sides both as the ai you know creators of the ai um but also as a games player originally so you know it was a it was a really interesting it was i mean it was a fantastic um but also somewhat bittersweet moment the alphago match for me um uh seeing that and and and being obviously heavily heavily involved in that um but you know as you say chess has been uh the i mean kasparov i think rightly called it the drosophila of of intelligence right so it's sort of i i love that phrase and and i think he's right because chess has been um hand in hand with ai from the beginning of the the whole field right so i think every ai practitioner starting with turing and claude shannon and all those uh the sort of forefathers of of of of the field um tried their hand at writing a chess program uh i've got original audition of claude shannon's first chess program i think it was 1949 uh the the original sort of uh paper and um they all did that and turing famously wrote a chess program that but all the computers around there were obviously too slow to run it so he had to run he had to be the computer right so he literally i think spent two or three days running his own program by hand with pencil and paper and playing playing a friend of his uh with his chess program so of course deep blue was a huge moment uh beating off um but actually when that happened i remember that very very vividly of course because it was you know chess and computers and ai all the things i loved and i was at college at the time but i remember coming away from that being more impressed by kasparov's mind than i was by deep blue because here was kasparov with his human mind not only could he play chess more or less to the same level as this brute of a calculation machine um but of course kasparov can do everything else humans can do ride a bike talk many languages do politics all the rest of the amazing things that kasparov does and so with the same brain yeah and and yet deep blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it had been hand coded for chess and um actually had distilled the knowledge of chess grand masters uh into into a cool program but it couldn't do anything else like it couldn't even play a strictly simpler game like tic-tac-toe so um something to me was missing from um intelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence and i think it was this idea of generality and and also learning yeah um so and that's what we tried to do out with alphago yeah we alphago and alpha zero mu zero and then got on all the things that uh we'll get into some parts of there's just a fascinating trajectory here but let's just stick on chess briefly uh on the human side of chess you've proposed that from a game design perspective the thing that makes chess compelling as a game uh is that there's a creative tension between a bishop and the knight can you explain this first of all it's really interesting to think about what makes the game compelling makes it stick across centuries yeah i was sort of thinking about this and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a games designer point of view so it's with my game design hat on that i was thinking about this why is chess so compelling and i think a critical uh reason is the the dynamicness of of of the different kind of chess positions you can have whether they're closed or open and other things comes from the bishop and the night so if you think about how different the the the capabilities of the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two capabilities more or less equally so they're both roughly worth three points each so you think that dynamics was always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game well maybe i mean it's sort of i don't know his chicken and egg situation probably both came together but the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop and knight they're so different in power um but so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions right somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years um i think gives gives the game the creative tension uh that you can swap the bishop and knights uh for a bishop for a knight and you you they're more or less worth the same but now you aim for a different type of position if you have the knight you want a closed position if you have the bishop you want an open position so i think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess so some kind of controlled creative tension from an ai perspective do you think ai systems convention design games that are optimally compelling to humans well that's an interesting question you know sometimes i get asked about ai and creativity and and this and the way i answered that is relevant to that question which is that i think they're different levels of creativity one could say so i think um if we define creativity as coming up with something original right that's that's useful for a purpose then you know i think the kind of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation so an averaging of all the examples you see so maybe a very basic ai system could say you could have that so you show it millions of pictures of cats and then you say give me an average looking cat right generate me an average looking cat i would call that interpolation then there's extrapolation which something like alphago showed so alphago played you know millions of games of go against itself and then it came up with brilliant new ideas like move 37 in game two bringing a motif strategies and go that that no humans had ever thought of even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years so that that i call that extrapolation but then that's still there's still a level above that which is you know you could call out the box thinking or true innovation which is could you invent go right could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move or brilliant go move but can you can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or go and i think one day uh ai could but what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a a program right now and the way i would do it if i was best telling a human to do it or a games designer a human games designer to do it is i would say something like go i would say um come up with a game that only takes five minutes to learn which go does because it's got simple rules but many lifetimes to master right or impossible to master in one lifetime because so deep and so complex um and then it's aesthetically beautiful uh and also uh it can be completed in three or four hours of gameplay time which is you know useful for our us you know in in a human day and so um you might specify these side of high level concepts like that and then you know with that and maybe a few other things uh one could imagine that go satisfies uh those those constraints um but the problem is is that we we're not able to specify abstract notions like that high-level abstract notions like that yet to our ai systems um and i think there's still something missing there in terms of um high-level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and that you know combinable and compositional um so for the moment i think ai is capable of doing interpolation extrapolation but not true invention so coming up with rule sets uh and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets we can't currently do but you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self-play experiment to see how long just observe how an ai system from scratch learns how long is that journey of learning and maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on and you could see a long journey to master for even an ai system then you could say that this is a promising game um but it would be nice to do almost like alpha codes or programming rules so generating rules that kind of uh that automate even that part of the generation of rules so i have thought about systems actually um that i think would be amazing in in for a games designer if you could have a system that um takes your game plays it tens of millions of times maybe overnight and then self balances the rules better so it tweaks the the rules and the maybe the equations and the and the and the parameters so that the game uh is more balanced the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked so it's a bit of like a giving a base set and then allowing a monte carlo tree search or something like that to sort of explore it right and i think that would be super super a powerful tool actually for for balancing auto balancing a game which usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of games human games testers normally to to balance some one you know game like starcraft which is you know blizzard are amazing at balancing their games but it takes them years and years and years so one could imagine at some point when this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient enough to you know you might be able to do that like overnight do you think a game that is optimal designed by an ai system would look very much like uh planet earth maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i would love to make is is and i've tried you know my in my game's career the games design career you know my first big game was designing a theme park an amusement park then uh with games like republic i tried to you know have games where we designed whole cities and and allowed you to play in so and of course people like will wright have written games like sim earth uh trying to simulate the whole of earth pretty tricky but um i see earth i haven't actually played that one so what is it does it incorporative evolution or yeah it has evolution and it's sort of um it tries to it sort of treats it as an entire biosphere but from quite a high level so nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom out zoom in exactly so obviously he couldn't do that was in the night i think he wrote that in the 90s so it couldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't able to do that but that that would be uh obviously the ultimate sandbox game of course on that topic do you think we're living in a simulation yes well so okay so i'm gonna jump around from the absurdly philosophical to the short term sure very very happy to so i think uh my answer to that question is a little bit complex because uh there is simulation theory which obviously nick bostrom i think famously first proposed um and uh i don't quite believe it in in that sense so um in the in the sense that uh are we in some sort of computer game or have our descendants somehow recreated uh uh earth in the you know 21st century and and some for some kind of experimental reason i think that um but i do think that we that that we might be that the best way to understand physics and the universe is from a computational perspective so understanding it as an information universe and actually information being the most fundamental unit of uh reality rather than matter or energy so a physicist would say you know matter or energy you know e equals m c squared these are the things that are are the fundamentals of the universe i'd actually say information um which of course itself can be can specify energy or matter right matter is actually just you know we're we're just out the way our bodies and all the molecules in our body arrange is information so i think information may be the most fundamental way to describe the universe and therefore you could say we're in some sort of simulation because of that um but i don't i do i'm not i'm not really a subscriber to the idea that um you know these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around i think this is actually very critical and possibly unique this simulation particular one yes so but and you just mean treating the universe as a computer that's processing and modifying information is is a good way to solve the problems of physics of chemistry of biology and perhaps of humanity and so on yes i think understanding physics in terms of information theory uh might be the best way to to really uh understand what's going on here from our understanding of a universal turing machine from our understanding of a computer do you think there's something outside of the capabilities of a computer that is present in our universe you have a disagreement with roger penrose the nature of consciousness he he thinks that consciousness is more than just a computation uh do you think all of it the whole shebang is can be can be a competition yeah i've had many fascinating debates with uh sir roger penrose and obviously he's he's famously and i read you know emperors of new mind and and um and his books uh his classical books uh and they they were pretty influential and you know in the 90s and um he believes that there's something more you know something quantum that is needed to explain consciousness in the brain um i think about what we're doing actually at deepmind and what my career is being we're almost like true rings champion so we are pushing turing machines or classical computation to the limits what are the limits of what classical computing can do now um and at the same time i've also studied neuroscience to see and that's why i did my phd in was to see also to look at you know is there anything quantum in the brain from a neuroscience or biological perspective and um and so far i think most neuroscientists and most mainstream biologists and neuroscientists would say there's no evidence of any quantum uh systems or effects in the brain as far as we can see it's it can be mostly explained by classical uh classical theories so and then so there's sort of the the search from the biology side and then at the same time there's the raising of the water uh at the bar from what classical turing machines can do uh uh and and you know including our new ai systems and uh as you alluded to earlier um you know i think ai especially in the last decade plus has been a continual story now of surprising uh events uh and surprising successes knocking over one theory after another of what was thought to be impossible you know from go to protein folding and so on and so i think i would be very hesitant to bet against how far the uh universal turing machine and classical computation paradigm can go and and my betting would be that all of certainly what's going on in our brain uh can probably be mimicked or or approximated on a on a classical machine um not you know not requiring something metaphysical or quantum and we'll get there with some of the work with alpha fold which i think begins the journey of modeling this beautiful and complex world of biology so you think all the magic of the human mind comes from this just a few pounds of mush of a biological computational mush akin to some of the neural networks not directly but in spirit that deep mind has been working with well look i think it's um you say it's a few you know of course it's this is the i think the biggest miracle of the universe is that um it is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls and yet it's also our brains are the most complex objects in the in that we know of in the universe so there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains and i think that it's an incredibly uh incredible efficient machine and and uh and it's a is you know phenomenal basically and i think that building ai one of the reasons i want to build ai and i've always wanted to is i think by building an intelligent artifact like ai and then comparing it to the human mind um that will help us unlock the uniqueness and the true secrets of the mind that we've always wondered about since the dawn of history like consciousness dreaming uh creativity uh emotions what are all these things right we've we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity and i think one of the reasons and you know i love philosophy and philosophy of mind is we found it difficult is there haven't been the tools for us to really other than introspection to from very clever people in in history very clever philosophers to really investigate this scientifically but now suddenly we have a plethora of tools firstly we have all the neuroscience tools fmri machines single cell recording all of this stuff but we also have the ability computers and ai to build uh intelligent systems so i think that um you know i think it is amazing what the human mind does and um and and i'm kind of in awe of it really and uh and i think it's amazing that without human minds we're able to build things like computers and and actually even you know think and investigate about these questions i think that's also a testament to the human mind yeah the universe built the human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind right that's exactly it i mean i think that's one you know one could say we we are maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand itself yeah it's beautiful so let's let's go to the basic building blocks of biology that i think is another angle at which you can start to understand the human mind the human body which is quite fascinating which is from the basic building blocks start to simulate start to model how from those building blocks you can construct bigger and bigger more complex systems maybe one day the entirety of the human biology so here's another problem that thought to be impossible to solve which is protein folding and alpha fold or specific alpha fold 2 did just that it solved protein folding i think it's one of the biggest breakthroughs uh certainly in the history of structural biology but uh in general in in science maybe from a high level what is it and how does it work and then we can ask some fascinating sure questions after sure um so maybe like to explain it uh to people not familiar with protein folding is you know i first of all explain proteins which is you know proteins are essential to all life every function in your body depends on proteins sometimes they're called the workhorses of biology and if you look into them and i've you know obviously as part of alpha fold i've been researching proteins and and structural biology for the last few years you know they're amazing little bio nano machines proteins they're incredible if you actually watch little videos of how they work animations of how they work and um proteins are specified by their genetic sequence called the amino acid sequence so you can think of those their genetic makeup and then in the body uh in in nature they when they when they fold up into a 3d structure so you can think of it as a string of beads and then they fold up into a ball now the key thing is you want to know what that 3d structure is because the structure the 3d structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it do the function it does in your body and also if you're interested in drug drugs or disease you need to understand that 3d structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound or about to block that something the protein is doing uh you need to understand where it's going to bind on the surface of the protein so obviously in order to do that you need to understand the 3d structure so the structure is mapped to the function the structure is mapped to the function and the structure is obviously somehow specified by the by the amino acid sequence and that's the in essence the protein folding problem is can you just from the amino acid sequence the one-dimensional string of letters can you immediately computationally predict the 3d structure right and this has been a grand challenge in biology for over 50 years so i think it was first articulated by christian anfinsen a nobel prize winner in 1972 uh as part of his nobel prize winning lecture and he just speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3d structure we didn't say how so i you know it's been described to me as equivalent to fermat's last theorem but for biology right you should as somebody that uh very well might win the nobel prize in the future but outside of that you should do more of that kind of thing in the margins just put random things that will take like 200 years to solve set people off for 200 years it should be possible exactly and just don't give any interest exactly i think everyone's exactly should be i'll have to remember that for future so yeah so he set off you know with this one throwaway remark just like fermat you know he he set off this whole 50-year uh uh uh field really of computational biology and and they had you know they got stuck they hadn't really got very far with doing this and and um until now until alpha fold came along this is done experimentally right very painstakingly so the rule of thumb is and you have to like crystallize the protein which is really difficult some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins and then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or x-ray crystallography machines really painstaking work to get the 3d structure and visualize the 3d structure so the rule of thumb in in experimental biology is that it takes one phd student their entire phd to do one protein uh and with alpha fold two we were able to predict the 3d structure in a matter of seconds um and so we were you know over christmas we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human body all 20 000 proteins so the human proteins like the equivalent of the human genome but on protein space and uh and sort of revolutionize really what uh a structural biologist can do because now um they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimentals you know should they put all of that effort in or not they can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a google search and so there's a data set on which it's trained and how to map this amino acids because first of all it's incredible that a protein this little chemical computer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly that's a weird thing and they evolved that way because you know in the beginning i mean that's a great invention just the protein itself yes i mean and then they there's i think probably a history of like uh they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers themselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to form high level functions i mean it's a weird system that they figured it out well for sure i mean we you know maybe we should talk about the origins of life too but proteins themselves i think are magical and incredible uh uh uh as i said little little bio-nano machines and and and actually levantal who is another scientist uh uh a contemporary of anfinsen uh he he coined this eleventh house what became known as levantal's paradox which is exactly what you're saying he calculated roughly a protein an average protein which is maybe 2 000 amino acids bases long is um is is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different conformations so there's 10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up and yet somehow in nature physics solves this solves this in a matter of milliseconds so proteins fold up in your body in you know sometimes in fractions of a second so physics is somehow solving that search problem and just to be clear in many of these cases maybe you correct me if i'm wrong there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself yes so among that huge number of possibilities yes it figures out a way how to stability in some cases there might be a misfunction so on which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that but yes most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious no exactly that's just what the problem is exactly so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy in if it's healthy and as you say in disease so for example alzheimer's one one one conjecture is that it's because of a misfolded protein a protein that folds in the wrong way amyloid beta protein so um and then because it falls in the wrong way it gets tangled up right in your in your neurons so um it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also disease is to understand uh you know what what these things are doing and how they're structuring of course the next step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something so um they're not just static necessarily in in biology maybe you can give some interesting sort of beautiful things to you about these early days of alpha fold of of solving this problem because unlike games this is real physical systems that are less amenable to self-play type of mechanisms the the size of the data set is smaller that you might otherwise like so you have to be very clever about certain things is there something you could speak to um what was very hard to solve and what are some beautiful aspects about the the solution yeah i would say alpha fold is the most complex and also probably most meaningful system we've built so far so it's been an amazing time actually in the last you know two three years to see that come through because um as we talked about earlier you know games is what we started on uh building things like alphago and alpha zero but really the ultimate goal was to um not just to crack games it was just to to to build use them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges specifically my passion is scientific challenges like protein folding and then alpha fold of course is our first big proof point of that and so um you know in terms of the data uh and the amount of innovations that had to go into it we you know it was like more than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding um i think some of the big innovations were that um kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and evolutionary biology um to constrain sort of things like the bond angles uh uh in the in the in the protein and things like that um a lot but not to impact the learning system so still allowing uh the system to be able to learn the physics uh itself um from the examples that we had and the examples as you say there are only about 150 000 proteins even after 40 years of experimental biology only around 150 000 proteins have been the structures have been found out about so that was our training set which is um much less than normally we would like to use but using various tricks things like self distillation so actually using alpha folds predictions um some of the best predictions that it thought was highly confident in we put them back into the training set right to make the training set bigger that was critical to to alpha fold working so there was actually a huge number of different um uh innovations like that that were required to to ultimately crack the problem after fold one what it produced was a distagram so a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances between all of the molecules in the in the in the protein and then there had to be a separate optimization process to uh create the 3d structure and what we did for alpha volt2 is make it truly end to end so we went straight from the amino acid sequence of of of bases to the 3d structure directly without going through this intermediate step and in machine learning what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make it the better the system and it's probably because um we you know the in the end the system is better at learning what the constraints are than than we are as the human designers of specifying it so anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for in this case the 3d structure you're better off than having this intermediate step which you then have to hand craft the next step for so so it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system um from the end point the end output you want to the inputs so that's a good way to start a new problem handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch of manual constraints with a small intent learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning piece until it consumes the whole thing that's right and so you can also see you know this is a bit of a method we've developed over doing many sort of successful outfits we call them alpha x projects right is and the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alphago to alpha zero so alphago was um a learning system but it was specifically trained to only play go right so uh and what we wanted to do with first version of go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it right and then and then of course alphago zero we we we removed the need to use human games as a starting point right so it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning so that removed the the need for human knowledge uh about go and then finally alpha zero then generalized it so that any things we had in there the system including things like symmetry of the go board uh were removed so the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu0 which is the final latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game it would learn that for itself so it could also deal with computer games as well as board games so that line of alpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero that's the full trajectory of what you can take from uh imitation learning to full self supervised learning yeah exactly and learning learning uh the entire structure of the environment you put in from scratch right and and and and bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh yourself but the thing is it would have been impossible i think or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out of the box even psychologically because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time you're constantly dealing with doubt because a lot of people say that it's impossible exactly so it was hard enough just to do go as you were saying everyone thought that was impossible or at least a decade away um from when we when we did it back in 2015 24 you know 2016 and um and so yes it would have been psychologically probably very difficult as well as the fact that of course we learnt a lot by building alphago first right so it's i think this is why i call ai in engineering science it's one of the most fascinating science disciplines but it's also an engineering science in the sense that unlike natural sciences um the phenomenon you're studying it doesn't exist out in nature you have to build it first so you have to build the artifact first and then you can study how how and pull it apart and how it works this is tough to uh ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything but let's let's try let's try to think to this because you're in a very interesting position where deepmind is the place of some of the most uh brilliant ideas in the history of ai but it's also a place of brilliant engineering so how much of solving intelligence this big goal for deepmind how much of it is science how much is engineering so how much is the algorithms how much is the data how much is the hardware compute infrastructure how much is it the software computer infrastructure yeah um what else is there how much is the human infrastructure and like just the humans interact in certain kinds of ways in all the space of all those ideas how much does maybe like philosophy how much what's the key if um if if you were to sort of look back like if we go forward 200 years look back what was the key thing that solved intelligence is that ideas i think it's a combination first of all of course it's a combination of all those things but the the ratios of them changed over over time so yeah so um even in the last 12 years so we started deep mine in 2010 which is hard to imagine now because 2010 it's only 12 short years ago but nobody was talking about ai uh you know if you remember back to your mit days you know no one was talking about it i did a postdoc at mit back around then and it was sort of thought of as a well look we know ai doesn't work we tried this hard in the 90s at places like mit mostly losing using logic systems and old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned ai we would call it now um people like minsky and and and patrick winston and you know all these characters right and used to debate a few of them and they used to think i was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with learning systems and um i was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at that point right even if every all of your you know professors are telling you you're mad that's true and of course in industry uh you can we couldn't get you know as difficult to get two cents together uh and which is hard to imagine now as well given it's the biggest sort of buzzword in in vcs and and fundraising's easy and all these kind of things today so back in 2010 it was very difficult and what we the reason we started then and shane and i used to discuss um uh uh what were the sort of founding tenets of deep mind and it was very various things one was um algorithmic advances so deep learning you know jeff hinton and cohen just had just sort of invented that in academia but no one in industry knew about it uh we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled up but also understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri machines and other things so we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and and sort of um representations maybe that the brain uses so as at a systems level not at a implementation level um and then the other big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and it got to a place where it became commoditized mostly through the games industry and and that could be taken advantage of and then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so things like ai xi aix which uh shane worked on with his supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort of theoretical uh proof really of universal intelligence um which is actually a reinforcement learning system um in the limit i mean it assumes infinite compute and infinite memory in the way you know like a turing machine proof but i was also waiting to see something like that too to you know like turing machines uh and and computation theory that people like turing and shannon came up with underpins modern computer science um uh you know i was waiting for a theory like that to sort of underpin agi research so when i you know met shane and saw he was working on something like that you know that to me was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw in the early days i would say that ideas were the most important uh you know and for us it was deep reinforcement learning scaling up deep learning um of course we've seen transformers so huge leaps i would say you know three or four from for if you think from 2010 until now uh huge evolutions things like alphago um and um and and maybe there's a few more still needed but as we get closer to ai agi um i think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the the recent you know results of gpt3 and all the big language models and large models including our ones uh has shown that scale is a is and large models are clearly going to be unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient part of an agi solution and throughout that like you said and i'd like to give you a big thank you you're one of the pioneers in this is sticking by ideas like reinforcement learning that this can actually work given actually limited success in the past and also which we still don't know but proudly having the best researchers in the world and talking about solving intelligence so talking about whatever you call it agi or something like this that speaking of mit that's that's just something not you wouldn't bring up no uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40 50 years ago but that was ai was a place where you do tinkering very small scale not very ambitious projects and maybe the biggest ambitious projects were in the space of robotics and doing like the darpa challenge sure but the task of solving intelligence and believing you can that's really really powerful so in order for engineering to do its work to have great engineers build great systems you have to have that belief that threats throughout the whole thing that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges yeah that's right and and back in 2010 you know our mission statement um and still is today you know it was used to be uh solving step one solve intelligence step two use it to solve everything else yes so if you can imagine pitching that to a vc in 2010 you know the kind of looks we we got we managed to you know find a few uh kooky people to back us but it was uh it was tricky and and i and i got to the point where we we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we you know committed career suicide and and uh and and you know so it was there's a lot of things that we had to do but we always believed it and one reason you know by the way one reason we i believe i've always believed in reinforcement learning is that that if you look at neuroscience that is the way that the you know primate brain learns one of the main mechanisms is the dopamine system implement some form of td learning a very famous result in the late 90s uh where they saw this in monkeys and uh and as a you know proper game prediction error so we you know again in the limit this is this is what i think you can use neuroscience for is is you know any at mathematics you when you're when you're doing something as ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and you're you're you know it's blue sky research no one knows how to do it you you you need to use any evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're going in the right direction so so that that was one reason we pushed so hard on that and that's and just going back to your early question about organization the other big thing that i think we innovated with at deepmind to encourage invention and and uh and innovation was the multi-disciplinary organization we built and we still have today so deepmind originally was a confluence of the of the most cutting-edge knowledge in neuroscience with machine learning engineering and mathematics right and and gaming and then since then we built that out even further so we have philosophers here and and uh by you know ethicists but also other types of scientists physicists and so on um and that's what brings together i tried to build a sort of um new type of bell labs but in this golden era right uh and and a new expression of that um to try and uh foster this incredible sort of innovation machine so talking about the humans in the machine the mind itself is a learning machine with a lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these uh learning systems if we return to the big ambitious dream of alpha fold that may be the early steps on a very long journey in um do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological systems so multi-protein interaction and then i mean you can go out from there just simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body just the big mush the mess of the beautiful resilient mesobiology do do you see that as a long-term vision i do and i think you know if you think about what are the things top things i wanted to apply ai ai2 once we had powerful enough systems biology and curing diseases and understanding biology uh was right up there you know top of my list that's one of the reasons i personally pushed that myself and with alpha fold but i think alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just 01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0% 01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.710 align:start position:0% the beginning um and and and i

position:0% then finally last year after alpha fault 01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0% 01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.990 align:start position:0% i said now is the time we can finally go 01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0% 01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.670 align:start position:0% for it and and alpha falls the first 01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0% 01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.589 align:start position:0% proof point that this might be possible 01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0% 01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:34.950 align:start position:0% uh and he's very excited when we have 01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0% 01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.630 align:start position:0% some collaborations with his with his 01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0% 01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.990 align:start position:0% lab they're just across the road 01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0% 01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.829 align:start position:0% actually from us as you know wonderful 01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0% 01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:41.030 align:start position:0% being here in king's cross with the 01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0% 01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.829 align:start position:0% quick institute across the road and um 01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0% 01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:45.829 align:start position:0% and i think the next steps you know i 01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0% 01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:47.270 align:start position:0% think there's going to be some amazing 01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0% 01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.109 align:start position:0% advances in biology built on top of 01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0% 01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:51.190 align:start position:0% things like alpha fold uh we're already 01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0% 01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.710 align:start position:0% seeing that with the community doing 01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0% 01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.150 align:start position:0% that after we've open sourced it and 01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0% 01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.589 align:start position:0% released it um and uh you know i also i 01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0% 01:01:57.599 --> 01:01:59.589 align:start position:0% often say that i think 01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0% 01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:02.390 align:start position:0% uh if you think of mathematics is the 01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0% 01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.950 align:start position:0% perfect description language for physics 01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0% 01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.710 align:start position:0% i think ai might be end up being the 01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0% 01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.109 align:start position:0% perfect description language for biology 01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0% 01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:10.069 align:start position:0% because 01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0% 01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:13.109 align:start position:0% biology is so messy it's so emergent so 01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0% 01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:15.829 align:start position:0% dynamic and complex um i think i find it 01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0% 01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:17.510 align:start position:0% very hard to believe we'll ever get to 01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0% 01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.270 align:start position:0% something as elegant as newton's laws of 01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0% 01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0% motions to describe a cell right it's 01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0% 01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.470 align:start position:0% just too complicated um so i think ai is 01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0% the right tool for this you have to uh 01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0% 01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.390 align:start position:0% you have to start at the basic building 01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0% 01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.349 align:start position:0% blocks and use ai to run the simulation 01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0% 01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:33.990 align:start position:0% for all those building blocks so have a 01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0% 01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.470 align:start position:0% very strong way to do prediction of what 01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0% 01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.910 align:start position:0% given these building blocks what kind of 01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0% 01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.190 align:start position:0% biology how the 01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0% 01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.630 align:start position:0% the function 01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0% 01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.470 align:start position:0% and the evolution of that biological 01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0% 01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.430 align:start position:0% system 01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0% 01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.270 align:start position:0% it's almost like a cellular automata you 01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0% 01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.190 align:start position:0% have to run you can't analyze it from a 01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0% 01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.109 align:start position:0% high level you have to take the basic 01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0% 01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:51.029 align:start position:0% ingredients figure out the rules yeah 01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0% 01:02:51.039 --> 01:02:52.710 align:start position:0% and let it run but in this case the 01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0% 01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0% rules are very difficult to figure out 01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0% 01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.950 align:start position:0% yes yes learn them that's exactly it so 01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0% 01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.190 align:start position:0% it's the biology is too complicated to 01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0% 01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.750 align:start position:0% figure out the rules it's it's it's too 01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0% 01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.230 align:start position:0% emergent too dynamic say compared to a 01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0% 01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.829 align:start position:0% physics system like the motion of a 01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0% 01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:08.309 align:start position:0% planet yeah right and and so you have to 01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0% 01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:09.829 align:start position:0% learn the rules and that's exactly the 01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0% 01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:11.910 align:start position:0% type of systems that we're building so 01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0% 01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.349 align:start position:0% you you mentioned you've open sourced 01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0% 01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:16.390 align:start position:0% alpha fold and even the data involved 01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0% 01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.190 align:start position:0% to me personally also 01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0% 01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.029 align:start position:0% really happy and a big thank you for 01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0% 01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:22.950 align:start position:0% open sourcing mijoko 01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.750 align:start position:0% uh the physics simulation engine that's 01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0% 01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.990 align:start position:0% that's often used for robotics research 01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0% 01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.829 align:start position:0% and so on so i think that's a pretty 01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0% 01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.109 align:start position:0% gangster move uh so what what's the 01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0% 01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:35.190 align:start position:0% what's i mean this uh 01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0% 01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0% very few companies or people would do 01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0% 01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.069 align:start position:0% that kind of thing what's the philosophy 01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0% 01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:42.309 align:start position:0% behind that you know it's a case-by-case 01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0% 01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.390 align:start position:0% basis and in both those cases we felt 01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0% 01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.630 align:start position:0% that was the maximum benefit to humanity 01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0% 01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.309 align:start position:0% to do that and and the scientific 01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0% 01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:51.190 align:start position:0% community in one case the robotics uh 01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0% 01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.270 align:start position:0% physics community with mojoco so 01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0% 01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.109 align:start position:0% purchased it we purchased 01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0% 01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:57.029 align:start position:0% to obs we purchased it for the express 01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0% 01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:59.270 align:start position:0% principle to open source it so 01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0% 01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.870 align:start position:0% um so 01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0% 01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.309 align:start position:0% you know i hope people appreciate that 01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0% 01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:04.309 align:start position:0% it's great to hear that you do and then 01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0% 01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:06.470 align:start position:0% the second thing was and mostly we did 01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0% 01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.789 align:start position:0% it because the person building it is uh 01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0% 01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:10.710 align:start position:0% uh would not it was not able to cope 01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0% 01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.990 align:start position:0% with supporting it anymore because it 01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0% 01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.990 align:start position:0% was it got too big for him his amazing 01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0% 01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.150 align:start position:0% professor uh who who built it in the 01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0% 01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.510 align:start position:0% first place so we helped him out with 01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0% 01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.109 align:start position:0% that and then with alpha folds even 01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0% 01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:21.190 align:start position:0% bigger i would say and i think in that 01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0% 01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.990 align:start position:0% case we decided that there were so many 01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0% 01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.270 align:start position:0% downstream applications of alpha fold um 01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0% 01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.270 align:start position:0% that we couldn't possibly even imagine 01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0% 01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.670 align:start position:0% what they all were so the best way to 01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0% 01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.870 align:start position:0% accelerate uh drug discovery and also 01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0% 01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.150 align:start position:0% fundamental research would be to to um 01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0% 01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.390 align:start position:0% give all that data away and and and the 01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0% 01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.190 align:start position:0% and the and the system itself um you 01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0% 01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.270 align:start position:0% know it's been so gratifying to see what 01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0% 01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.710 align:start position:0% people have done that within just one 01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0% 01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.309 align:start position:0% year which is a short amount of time in 01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0% 01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0% science and uh it's been used by 01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0% 01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.150 align:start position:0% over 500 000 researchers have used it we 01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0% 01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.750 align:start position:0% think that's almost every biologist in 01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0% 01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.589 align:start position:0% the world i think there's roughly 500 01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0% 01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.109 align:start position:0% 000 biologists in the world professional 01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0% 01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:01.349 align:start position:0% biologists have used it to to look at 01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0% 01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:04.309 align:start position:0% their proteins of interest 01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0% 01:05:04.319 --> 01:05:06.150 align:start position:0% we've seen amazing fundamental research 01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0% 01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.470 align:start position:0% done so a couple of weeks ago front 01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0% 01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.150 align:start position:0% cover there was a whole special issue of 01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0% 01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.069 align:start position:0% science including the front cover which 01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0% 01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:14.069 align:start position:0% had the nuclear pore complex on it which 01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0% 01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:15.349 align:start position:0% is one of the biggest proteins in the 01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0% 01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:17.510 align:start position:0% body the nuclear poor complex is a 01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0% 01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.670 align:start position:0% protein that governs all the nutrients 01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0% 01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.069 align:start position:0% going in and out of your cell nucleus so 01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0% 01:05:22.079 --> 01:05:23.589 align:start position:0% they're like little hole gateways that 01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0% 01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:25.829 align:start position:0% open and close to let things go in and 01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0% 01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.430 align:start position:0% out of your cell nucleus so they're 01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0% 01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.190 align:start position:0% really important but they're huge 01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0% 01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.630 align:start position:0% because they're massive doughnut rings 01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0% 01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.549 align:start position:0% shaped things and they've been looking 01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0% 01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:33.990 align:start position:0% to try and figure out that structure for 01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0% 01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.069 align:start position:0% decades and they have lots of you know 01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0% 01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.750 align:start position:0% experimental data but it's too low 01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0% 01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.670 align:start position:0% resolution there's bits missing and they 01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0% 01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.230 align:start position:0% were able to like a giant lego jigsaw 01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0% 01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.789 align:start position:0% puzzle use alpha fold predictions plus 01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0% 01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:47.589 align:start position:0% experimental data and combined those two 01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0% 01:05:47.599 --> 01:05:49.670 align:start position:0% independent sources of information uh 01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0% 01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.870 align:start position:0% actually four different groups around 01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0% 01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.630 align:start position:0% the world were able to put it together 01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0% 01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.549 align:start position:0% the sec more or less simultaneously 01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0% 01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.390 align:start position:0% using alpha fault predictions so that's 01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0% 01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.150 align:start position:0% been amazing to see and pretty much 01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0% 01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.230 align:start position:0% every pharma company every drug company 01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0% 01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.750 align:start position:0% executive i've spoken to has said that 01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0% 01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.829 align:start position:0% their teams are using alpha fold to 01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0% 01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:06.870 align:start position:0% accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're 01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0% 01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.470 align:start position:0% trying to discover so i think the 01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0% 01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.510 align:start position:0% knock-on effect has been enormous in 01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0% 01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.150 align:start position:0% terms of uh the impact that uh 01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0% 01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.589 align:start position:0% alpha-fold has made and it's probably 01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0% 01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:17.670 align:start position:0% bringing in it's creating biologists 01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0% 01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.910 align:start position:0% it's bringing more people into the field 01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0% 01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.710 align:start position:0% 01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0% 01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.390 align:start position:0% both on the excitement and both on the 01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0% 01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.390 align:start position:0% technical skills involved 01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0% 01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0% and um 01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0% 01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.910 align:start position:0% it's almost like uh a gateway drug to 01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0% 01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.990 align:start position:0% biology yes it is you get more 01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0% 01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.589 align:start position:0% computational people involved too 01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0% 01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:33.910 align:start position:0% hopefully and and i think for us you 01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0% 01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.750 align:start position:0% know the next stage as i said you know 01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0% 01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.029 align:start position:0% in future we have to have other 01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0% 01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:38.710 align:start position:0% considerations too we're building on top 01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0% 01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.470 align:start position:0% of alpha fold and these other ideas i 01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0% 01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.990 align:start position:0% discussed with you about protein protein 01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0% 01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.150 align:start position:0% interactions and and genomics and other 01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0% 01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.829 align:start position:0% things and not everything will be open 01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0% 01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:47.270 align:start position:0% source some of it will will do 01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0% 01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.470 align:start position:0% commercially because that will be the 01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0% 01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0% best way to actually get the most 01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0% 01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.910 align:start position:0% resources and impact behind it in other 01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0% 01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.750 align:start position:0% ways some other projects will do 01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0% 01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.390 align:start position:0% non-profit style um and also we have to 01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0% 01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.470 align:start position:0% consider for future things as well 01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0% 01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.069 align:start position:0% safety and ethics as well like but you 01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:00.079 --> 01:07:02.069 align:start position:0% know synthetic biology there are you 01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:04.069 align:start position:0% know there is dual use and we have to 01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:05.750 align:start position:0% think about that as well with alpha fold 01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0% 01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.430 align:start position:0% we you know we consulted with 30 01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0% 01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.109 align:start position:0% different bioethicists and and other 01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0% 01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:10.549 align:start position:0% people expert in this field to make sure 01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0% 01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.589 align:start position:0% it was safe before um we released it so 01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0% 01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:14.870 align:start position:0% there'll be other considerations in 01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0% 01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.230 align:start position:0% future but for right now you know i 01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0% 01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.230 align:start position:0% think alpha fold is a kind of a gift 01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0% 01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.069 align:start position:0% from us to to to the scientific 01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0% community so i'm pretty sure 01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:22.870 align:start position:0% 01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0% 01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.190 align:start position:0% something like alpha fold 01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0% 01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.829 align:start position:0% uh would be part of nobel prizes in the 01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0% 01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:29.029 align:start position:0% future 01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0% 01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:31.349 align:start position:0% but us humans of course are horrible 01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0% 01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:32.870 align:start position:0% with credit assignment so we'll of 01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0% 01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.510 align:start position:0% course give it to the humans 01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0% 01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.510 align:start position:0% do you think there will be a day 01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0% 01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.710 align:start position:0% when ai system 01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0% 01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.470 align:start position:0% can't be denied 01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0% 01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.190 align:start position:0% that it earned that nobel prize do you 01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0% 01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.430 align:start position:0% think we'll see that in 21st century it 01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0% 01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.190 align:start position:0% depends what type of ais we end up 01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0% 01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.069 align:start position:0% building right whether they're um 01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0% 01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:53.670 align:start position:0% you know goal seeking agents who 01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0% 01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.390 align:start position:0% specifies the goals uh who comes up with 01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0% 01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.750 align:start position:0% the hypotheses 01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0% 01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.029 align:start position:0% who you know who determines which 01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0% 01:07:59.039 --> 01:08:01.270 align:start position:0% problems to tackle right so i think it's 01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0% 01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.950 align:start position:0% about an announcement yeah so it's 01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0% 01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.870 align:start position:0% announcing the results exactly as part 01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0% 01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.670 align:start position:0% of it um so i think right now of course 01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0% 01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.230 align:start position:0% it's it's it's it's amazing human 01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0% 01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.069 align:start position:0% ingenuity that's behind these systems 01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0% 01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.589 align:start position:0% and then the system in my opinion is 01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0% 01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:15.670 align:start position:0% just a tool you know it'd be a bit like 01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0% 01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.990 align:start position:0% saying with galileo and his telescope 01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0% 01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.669 align:start position:0% you know the ingenuity the the the 01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0% 01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.349 align:start position:0% credit should go to the telescope i mean 01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0% 01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.430 align:start position:0% it's clearly galileo building the tool 01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0% 01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.110 align:start position:0% which he then uses 01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0% 01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.870 align:start position:0% so i still see that in the same way 01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0% 01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.950 align:start position:0% today even though these tools learn for 01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0% 01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.829 align:start position:0% themselves um they're i think i think of 01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0% 01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:33.510 align:start position:0% things like alpha fold and that the 01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0% 01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.110 align:start position:0% things we're building as the ultimate 01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0% 01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.149 align:start position:0% tools for science and for acquiring new 01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0% 01:08:38.159 --> 01:08:39.669 align:start position:0% knowledge to help us as scientists 01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0% 01:08:39.679 --> 01:08:42.070 align:start position:0% acquire new knowledge i think one day 01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0% 01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.309 align:start position:0% there will come a point where 01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0% 01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.870 align:start position:0% an ai system may solve or come up with 01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0% 01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.030 align:start position:0% something like general relativity of its 01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0% 01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.110 align:start position:0% own bat not just by 01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0% 01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.630 align:start position:0% averaging everything on the internet or 01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0% 01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.030 align:start position:0% averaging everything on pubmed 01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0% 01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.990 align:start position:0% although that would be interesting to 01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0% 01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.470 align:start position:0% see what that would come up with um so 01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0% 01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.990 align:start position:0% that to me is a bit like our earlier 01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0% 01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.990 align:start position:0% debate about creativity you know 01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0% 01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0% inventing go rather than just coming up 01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0% 01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.229 align:start position:0% with a good go move and um so i think uh 01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0% 01:09:08.239 --> 01:09:10.470 align:start position:0% solving i think to to you know if we 01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0% 01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.309 align:start position:0% wanted to give it the credit of like a 01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0% 01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.910 align:start position:0% nobel type of thing then it would need 01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0% 01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0% to invent go uh and sort of invent that 01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0% 01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.590 align:start position:0% new conjecture out of the blue um rather 01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0% 01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.070 align:start position:0% than being specified by the the human 01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0% 01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.669 align:start position:0% scientists or the human creators so i 01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0% 01:09:23.679 --> 01:09:25.430 align:start position:0% think right now that's it's definitely 01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0% 01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.110 align:start position:0% just a tool although it is interesting 01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0% 01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.709 align:start position:0% how far you get by averaging everything 01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0% 01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:30.470 align:start position:0% on the internet like you said because 01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0% 01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.510 align:start position:0% you know 01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0% 01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.590 align:start position:0% a lot of people do see science as you're 01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0% 01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.709 align:start position:0% always standing on the shoulders of 01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0% 01:09:34.719 --> 01:09:36.390 align:start position:0% giants and 01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0% 01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.630 align:start position:0% the question is how much are you really 01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0% 01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.990 align:start position:0% reaching 01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0% 01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.229 align:start position:0% up above the shoulders of giants maybe 01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0% 01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:44.550 align:start position:0% it's just assimilating different kinds 01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0% 01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.510 align:start position:0% of 01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0% 01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.430 align:start position:0% results of the past 01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0% 01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.189 align:start position:0% with ultimately this new perspective 01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0% 01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:50.950 align:start position:0% that gives you this breakthrough idea 01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0% 01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.590 align:start position:0% but that idea may not be 01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0% 01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.270 align:start position:0% novel in the way that we can't be 01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0% 01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.870 align:start position:0% already discovered on the internet maybe 01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0% 01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.630 align:start position:0% the nobel prizes 01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0% 01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.709 align:start position:0% of the next 100 years are already all 01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0% 01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:03.110 align:start position:0% there on the internet to be discovered 01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0% 01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.110 align:start position:0% they could be they could be i mean i 01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0% 01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.270 align:start position:0% think um 01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0% 01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.870 align:start position:0% this is one of the big mysteries i think 01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0% 01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.149 align:start position:0% is that uh 01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0% 01:10:10.159 --> 01:10:12.390 align:start position:0% uh i i first of all i believe a lot of 01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0% 01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.910 align:start position:0% the big new breakthroughs that are going 01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0% 01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.510 align:start position:0% to come in the next few decades and even 01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0% 01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.350 align:start position:0% in the last decade are going to come at 01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0% 01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.790 align:start position:0% the intersection between different 01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0% 01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.510 align:start position:0% subject areas where um there'll be some 01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0% 01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.310 align:start position:0% new connection that's found between what 01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.390 align:start position:0% seemingly with disparate areas and and 01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0% 01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.149 align:start position:0% one can even think of deep mind as i 01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0% 01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:29.510 align:start position:0% said earlier as a sort of 01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0% 01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.189 align:start position:0% interdisciplinary between neuroscience 01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0% 01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:33.990 align:start position:0% ideas and ai engineering ideas uh 01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0% 01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.189 align:start position:0% originally and so um so i think there's 01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0% 01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.270 align:start position:0% that and then one of the things we can't 01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0% 01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.030 align:start position:0% imagine today is and one of the reasons 01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0% 01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.709 align:start position:0% i think people we were so surprised by 01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0% 01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:44.950 align:start position:0% how well large models worked is that 01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0% 01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.990 align:start position:0% actually 01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0% 01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.830 align:start position:0% it's very hard for our human minds our 01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0% 01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.430 align:start position:0% limited human minds to understand what 01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0% 01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.870 align:start position:0% it would be like to read the whole 01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0% 01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.550 align:start position:0% internet right i think we can do a 01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0% 01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.229 align:start position:0% thought experiment and i used to do this 01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0% 01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:55.990 align:start position:0% of like well what if i read the whole of 01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0% 01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.350 align:start position:0% wikipedia 01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0% 01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.110 align:start position:0% what would i know and i think our minds 01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0% 01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.790 align:start position:0% can just about comprehend maybe what 01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.470 align:start position:0% that would be like but the whole 01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0% 01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.709 align:start position:0% internet is beyond comprehension so i 01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0% 01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.310 align:start position:0% think we just don't understand what it 01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0% 01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.630 align:start position:0% would be like to be able to hold all of 01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0% 01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.189 align:start position:0% that in mind potentially right and then 01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0% 01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:13.750 align:start position:0% active at once and then maybe what are 01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0% 01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.590 align:start position:0% the connections that are available there 01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0% 01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.110 align:start position:0% so i think no doubt there are huge 01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0% 01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.110 align:start position:0% things to be discovered just like that 01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0% 01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.350 align:start position:0% but i do think there is this other type 01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0% 01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.830 align:start position:0% of creativity of true spark of new 01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0% 01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.149 align:start position:0% knowledge new idea never thought before 01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0% 01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:27.990 align:start position:0% about can't be average from things that 01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0% 01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.709 align:start position:0% are known um that really of course 01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0% 01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.630 align:start position:0% everything come you know nobody creates 01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0% 01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.470 align:start position:0% in a vacuum so there must be clues 01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0% 01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.950 align:start position:0% somewhere but just a unique way of 01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0% 01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.709 align:start position:0% putting those things together i think 01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0% 01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:39.910 align:start position:0% some of the greatest scientists in 01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0% 01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.990 align:start position:0% history have displayed that i would say 01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0% 01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.070 align:start position:0% although it's very hard to know going 01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0% 01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.830 align:start position:0% back to their time what was exactly 01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0% 01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.750 align:start position:0% known uh when they came up with those 01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0% 01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.070 align:start position:0% things although 01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0% 01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.669 align:start position:0% you're making me really think because 01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0% 01:11:51.679 --> 01:11:53.910 align:start position:0% just the thought experiment of deeply 01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0% 01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.189 align:start position:0% knowing a hundred wikipedia pages 01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0% 01:11:57.199 --> 01:11:59.030 align:start position:0% i don't think i can um 01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0% 01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.270 align:start position:0% i've been really impressed by wikipedia 01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0% 01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.669 align:start position:0% for for technical topics yeah so if you 01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0% 01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:06.870 align:start position:0% know a hundred pages or a thousand pages 01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0% 01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.189 align:start position:0% i don't think who can visually truly 01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0% 01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:11.189 align:start position:0% comprehend what's 01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0% 01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:13.270 align:start position:0% what kind of intelligence that is that's 01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0% 01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.870 align:start position:0% a pretty powerful intelligence if you 01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0% 01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.790 align:start position:0% know how to use that and integrate that 01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0% 01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.470 align:start position:0% information correctly yes i think you 01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0% 01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.390 align:start position:0% can go really far you can probably 01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0% 01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.550 align:start position:0% construct thought experiments based on 01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0% 01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.590 align:start position:0% 01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0% 01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.229 align:start position:0% like simulate different ideas so if this 01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0% 01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:28.149 align:start position:0% is true let me run this thought 01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0% 01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:30.149 align:start position:0% experiment then maybe this is true it's 01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0% 01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:32.390 align:start position:0% not really invention it's like just 01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0% 01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.189 align:start position:0% taking literally the knowledge and using 01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0% 01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:37.110 align:start position:0% it to construct a very basic simulation 01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0% 01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.030 align:start position:0% of the world i mean some argue it's 01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0% 01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.030 align:start position:0% romantic in part but einstein would do 01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0% 01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.030 align:start position:0% the same kind of things with a thought 01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0% 01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.030 align:start position:0% experiment yeah one could imagine doing 01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0% 01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.189 align:start position:0% that systematically across millions of 01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0% 01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:49.510 align:start position:0% wikipedia pages plus pubmed all these 01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0% 01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.990 align:start position:0% things i think there are 01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0% 01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.669 align:start position:0% many many things to be discovered like 01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0% 01:12:53.679 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0% that they're hugely useful you know you 01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0% 01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.030 align:start position:0% could imagine and i want us to do some 01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0% 01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.470 align:start position:0% of those things in material science like 01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0% 01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.990 align:start position:0% room temperature superconductors or 01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0% 01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.070 align:start position:0% something on my list one day i'd like to 01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0% 01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.149 align:start position:0% like you know have an ai system to help 01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0% 01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.709 align:start position:0% build better optimized batteries all of 01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0% 01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:08.950 align:start position:0% these sort of mechanical things mr i 01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0% 01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.669 align:start position:0% think a systematic sort of search could 01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0% 01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:13.030 align:start position:0% be uh 01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0% 01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.590 align:start position:0% guided by a model could be um could be 01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0% 01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.990 align:start position:0% extremely powerful so speaking of which 01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0% 01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.870 align:start position:0% you have a paper on nuclear fusion 01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0% 01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.950 align:start position:0% uh magnetic control of tokamak plasmas 01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.310 align:start position:0% to deep reinforcement learning so you uh 01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0% 01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.070 align:start position:0% you're seeking to solve nuclear fusion 01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0% 01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.590 align:start position:0% with deep rl 01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0% 01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.709 align:start position:0% so it's doing control of high 01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0% 01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:32.470 align:start position:0% temperature plasmas can you explain this 01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0% 01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.430 align:start position:0% work 01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0% 01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.830 align:start position:0% and uh can ai eventually solve nuclear 01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0% 01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.110 align:start position:0% fusion 01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0% 01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.270 align:start position:0% it's been very fun last year or two and 01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0% 01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.550 align:start position:0% very productive because we've been 01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0% 01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.310 align:start position:0% taking off a lot of my 01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0% 01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.070 align:start position:0% dream projects if you like of things 01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0% 01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.910 align:start position:0% that i've collected over the years of 01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0% 01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.070 align:start position:0% areas of science that i would like to i 01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0% 01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.830 align:start position:0% think could be very transformative if we 01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0% 01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.310 align:start position:0% helped accelerate and uh really 01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0% 01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.910 align:start position:0% interesting problems scientific 01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0% 01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.750 align:start position:0% challenges in of themselves 01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0% 01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.550 align:start position:0% this is energy so energy yes exactly so 01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0% 01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.550 align:start position:0% energy and climate so we talked about 01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0% 01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.229 align:start position:0% disease and biology as being one of the 01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0% 01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:04.390 align:start position:0% biggest places i think ai can help with 01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0% 01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.630 align:start position:0% i think energy and climate uh is another 01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0% 01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.430 align:start position:0% one so maybe they would be my top two um 01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0% 01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.590 align:start position:0% and fusion is one one area i think ai 01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0% 01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.390 align:start position:0% can help with now fusion has many 01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.550 align:start position:0% challenges mostly physics material 01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0% 01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.149 align:start position:0% science and engineering challenges as 01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0% 01:14:18.159 --> 01:14:19.830 align:start position:0% well to build these massive fusion 01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0% 01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.910 align:start position:0% reactors and contain the plasma and what 01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0% 01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.669 align:start position:0% we try to do whenever we go into a new 01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0% 01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:24.950 align:start position:0% field 01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0% 01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.510 align:start position:0% to apply our systems is we look for um 01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0% 01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.430 align:start position:0% we talk to domain experts we try and 01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0% 01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.630 align:start position:0% find the best people in the world to 01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0% 01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.790 align:start position:0% collaborate with um 01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0% 01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.390 align:start position:0% in this case in fusion we we 01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0% 01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.149 align:start position:0% collaborated with epfl in switzerland 01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0% 01:14:36.159 --> 01:14:37.430 align:start position:0% the swiss technical institute who are 01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0% 01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.669 align:start position:0% amazing they have a test reactor that 01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0% 01:14:39.679 --> 01:14:41.430 align:start position:0% they were willing to let us use which 01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0% 01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.110 align:start position:0% you know i double checked with the team 01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0% 01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.550 align:start position:0% we were going to use carefully and 01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0% 01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.830 align:start position:0% safely 01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0% 01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.350 align:start position:0% i was impressed they managed to persuade 01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0% 01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.550 align:start position:0% them to let us use it and um and it's a 01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0% 01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.630 align:start position:0% it's an amazing test reactor they have 01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0% 01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.110 align:start position:0% there and they try all sorts of pretty 01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0% 01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.149 align:start position:0% crazy experiments on it and um the the 01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0% 01:14:58.159 --> 01:14:59.910 align:start position:0% the what we tend to look at is if we go 01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0% 01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.990 align:start position:0% into a new domain like fusion what are 01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0% 01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.229 align:start position:0% all the bottleneck problems uh like 01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0% 01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:05.750 align:start position:0% thinking from first principles you know 01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0% 01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.790 align:start position:0% what are all the bottleneck problems 01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0% 01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.310 align:start position:0% that are still stopping fusion working 01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0% 01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.310 align:start position:0% today and then we look at we you know we 01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0% 01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.149 align:start position:0% get a fusion expert to tell us and then 01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0% 01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:13.910 align:start position:0% we look at those bottlenecks and we look 01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0% 01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.229 align:start position:0% at the ones which ones are amenable to 01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0% 01:15:16.239 --> 01:15:19.430 align:start position:0% our ai methods today yes right and and 01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0% 01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.110 align:start position:0% and then and would be interesting from a 01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0% 01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.709 align:start position:0% research perspective from our point of 01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0% 01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.470 align:start position:0% view from an ai point of view and that 01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.550 align:start position:0% would address one of their bottlenecks 01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0% 01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.790 align:start position:0% and in this case plasma control was was 01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0% 01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.189 align:start position:0% perfect so you know the plasma it's a 01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0% 01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:32.790 align:start position:0% million degrees celsius something like 01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0% 01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.870 align:start position:0% that it's hotter than the sun 01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0% 01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.470 align:start position:0% and there's obviously no material that 01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0% 01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.070 align:start position:0% can contain it so they have to be 01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0% 01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.149 align:start position:0% containing these magnetic very powerful 01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0% 01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:42.550 align:start position:0% superconducting magnetic fields but the 01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0% 01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.790 align:start position:0% problem is plasma is pretty unstable as 01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0% 01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.310 align:start position:0% you imagine you're kind of holding a 01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0% 01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.590 align:start position:0% mini sun mini star in a reactor so you 01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0% 01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.350 align:start position:0% know you you kind of want to predict 01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0% 01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0% ahead of time 01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0% 01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.550 align:start position:0% what the plasma's going to do so you can 01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0% 01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.790 align:start position:0% move the magnetic field within a few 01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0% 01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.030 align:start position:0% milliseconds you know to to basically 01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0% 01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.030 align:start position:0% contain what it's going to do next so it 01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0% 01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.470 align:start position:0% seems like a perfect problem if you 01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0% 01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.229 align:start position:0% think of it for like a reinforcement 01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0% 01:16:04.239 --> 01:16:06.870 align:start position:0% learning prediction problem so uh you 01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0% 01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.390 align:start position:0% know your controller you're gonna move 01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0% 01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.709 align:start position:0% the magnetic field and until we came 01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0% 01:16:10.719 --> 01:16:12.070 align:start position:0% along you know they were they were doing 01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0% 01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.390 align:start position:0% it with with traditional operational uh 01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.950 align:start position:0% research type of uh controllers uh which 01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0% 01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.630 align:start position:0% are kind of handcrafted and the problem 01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0% 01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.990 align:start position:0% is of course they can't react in the 01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0% 01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.430 align:start position:0% moment to something the plasma's doing 01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0% 01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.110 align:start position:0% that they have to be hard-coded and 01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0% 01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.030 align:start position:0% again knowing that that's normally our 01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0% 01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.870 align:start position:0% go-to solution is we would like to learn 01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0% 01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.470 align:start position:0% that instead and they also had a 01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0% 01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.470 align:start position:0% simulator of these plasma so there were 01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0% 01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.470 align:start position:0% lots of criteria that matched what we we 01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0% 01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.709 align:start position:0% like to to to use 01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0% 01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:37.590 align:start position:0% so can ai eventually solve nuclear 01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0% 01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.750 align:start position:0% fusion well so we with this problem and 01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0% 01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.270 align:start position:0% we published it in a nature paper last 01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0% 01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.070 align:start position:0% year uh we held the fusion that we held 01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0% 01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.149 align:start position:0% the plasma in specific shapes so 01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0% 01:16:46.159 --> 01:16:47.830 align:start position:0% actually it's almost like carving the 01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0% 01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.990 align:start position:0% plasma into different shapes and control 01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0% 01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.990 align:start position:0% and hold it there for the record amount 01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0% 01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.470 align:start position:0% of time so um so that's one of the 01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0% 01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.430 align:start position:0% problems of of fusion sort of um solved 01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0% 01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.830 align:start position:0% so i have a controller that's able to no 01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0% 01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.310 align:start position:0% matter the shape uh contain it continue 01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0% 01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.070 align:start position:0% yeah contain it and hold it in structure 01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0% 01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.350 align:start position:0% and there's different shapes that are 01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0% 01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.669 align:start position:0% better for for the energy productions 01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0% 01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:10.630 align:start position:0% called droplets and and and so on so um 01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0% 01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.550 align:start position:0% so that was huge and now we're looking 01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0% 01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.310 align:start position:0% we're talking to lots of fusion startups 01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0% 01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.229 align:start position:0% to see what's the next problem we can 01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0% 01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:19.270 align:start position:0% tackle uh in the fusion area 01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0% 01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.149 align:start position:0% so another fascinating place 01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0% 01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.910 align:start position:0% in a paper title pushing the frontiers 01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0% 01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.669 align:start position:0% of density functionals by solving the 01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0% 01:17:25.679 --> 01:17:27.750 align:start position:0% fractional electron problem so you're 01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0% 01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.270 align:start position:0% taking on 01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0% 01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.430 align:start position:0% modeling and simulating the quantum 01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0% 01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.870 align:start position:0% mechanical behavior of electrons yes 01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0% 01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.910 align:start position:0% 01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0% 01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.470 align:start position:0% can you explain this work and can ai 01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0% 01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.630 align:start position:0% model and simulate arbitrary quantum 01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0% 01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.390 align:start position:0% mechanical systems in the future yeah so 01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0% 01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.990 align:start position:0% this is another problem i've had my eye 01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0% 01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.350 align:start position:0% on for you know a decade or more which 01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0% 01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.470 align:start position:0% is um 01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0% 01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.470 align:start position:0% uh sort of simulating the properties of 01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0% 01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.630 align:start position:0% electrons if you can do that you can 01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0% 01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.350 align:start position:0% basically describe how elements and 01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0% 01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.709 align:start position:0% materials and substances work so it's 01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0% 01:17:58.719 --> 01:18:00.390 align:start position:0% kind of like fundamental if you want to 01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0% 01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.669 align:start position:0% advance material science um and uh you 01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0% 01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.189 align:start position:0% know we have schrodinger's equation and 01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:06.709 align:start position:0% then we have approximations to that 01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0% 01:18:06.719 --> 01:18:08.870 align:start position:0% density functional theory these things 01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0% 01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.430 align:start position:0% are you know are famous and um people 01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0% 01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.990 align:start position:0% try and write approximations to to these 01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0% 01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.310 align:start position:0% uh uh to these functionals and and kind 01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0% 01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.790 align:start position:0% of come up with descriptions of the 01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0% 01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.550 align:start position:0% electron clouds where they're gonna go 01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0% 01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.470 align:start position:0% how they're gonna interact when you put 01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0% 01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.950 align:start position:0% two elements together uh and what we try 01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0% 01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.590 align:start position:0% to do is learn a simulation uh uh 01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0% 01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.750 align:start position:0% learner functional that will describe 01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0% 01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.870 align:start position:0% more chemistry types of chemistry so um 01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0% 01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.709 align:start position:0% until now you know you can run expensive 01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0% 01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:36.229 align:start position:0% simulations but then you can only 01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0% 01:18:36.239 --> 01:18:38.950 align:start position:0% simulate very small uh molecules very 01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0% 01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.630 align:start position:0% simple molecules we would like to 01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0% 01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.910 align:start position:0% simulate large materials um and so uh 01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0% 01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.750 align:start position:0% today there's no way of doing that and 01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0% 01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.830 align:start position:0% we're building up towards uh building 01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0% 01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.750 align:start position:0% functionals that approximate 01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0% 01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.990 align:start position:0% schrodinger's equation and then allow 01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0% 01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.630 align:start position:0% you to describe uh what the electrons 01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0% 01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.669 align:start position:0% are doing 01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0% 01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:57.430 align:start position:0% and all materials sort of science and 01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0% 01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.189 align:start position:0% material properties are governed by the 01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0% 01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:02.310 align:start position:0% electrons and and how they interact so 01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0% 01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.470 align:start position:0% have a good summarization of the 01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0% 01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.350 align:start position:0% simulation through the functional 01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0% 01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.630 align:start position:0% 01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0% 01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.870 align:start position:0% but one that is still 01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0% 01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.390 align:start position:0% close to what the actual simulation 01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0% 01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.510 align:start position:0% would come out with so what um 01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0% 01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.790 align:start position:0% how difficult is that to ask what's 01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0% 01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.229 align:start position:0% involved in that task is it running 01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0% 01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:18.950 align:start position:0% those 01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0% 01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.189 align:start position:0% those complicated simulations yeah and 01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0% 01:19:21.199 --> 01:19:23.510 align:start position:0% learning the task of mapping from the 01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0% 01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.189 align:start position:0% initial conditions and the parameters of 01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0% 01:19:25.199 --> 01:19:26.790 align:start position:0% the simulation learning what the 01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0% 01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.790 align:start position:0% functional would be yeah so it's pretty 01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0% 01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.030 align:start position:0% tricky and we've done it with um you 01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0% 01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.870 align:start position:0% know the nice thing is we there are we 01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0% 01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.189 align:start position:0% can run a lot of the simulations that 01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0% 01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:37.430 align:start position:0% the molecular dynamics simulations on 01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0% 01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.590 align:start position:0% our compute clusters and so that 01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0% 01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.350 align:start position:0% generates a lot of data so in this case 01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0% 01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.990 align:start position:0% the data is generated so we like those 01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0% 01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.430 align:start position:0% sort of systems and that's why we use 01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0% 01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.310 align:start position:0% games simulator generated data 01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0% 01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.669 align:start position:0% and we can kind of create as much of it 01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0% 01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:52.070 align:start position:0% as we want really um and just let's 01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0% 01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.990 align:start position:0% leave some you know if any computers are 01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0% 01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.229 align:start position:0% free in the cloud we just run we run 01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0% 01:19:56.239 --> 01:19:58.149 align:start position:0% some of these calculations right compute 01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0% 01:19:58.159 --> 01:20:00.070 align:start position:0% cluster calculation that's all the the 01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0% 01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.750 align:start position:0% free compute times used up on quantum 01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0% 01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.350 align:start position:0% mechanics quantum mechanics exactly 01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0% 01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.350 align:start position:0% simulations and protein simulations and 01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0% 01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.310 align:start position:0% other things and so um and so you know 01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0% 01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.149 align:start position:0% when you're not searching on youtube for 01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0% 01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:11.830 align:start position:0% video cat videos we're using those 01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0% 01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.590 align:start position:0% computers usefully and quantum chemistry 01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0% 01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.790 align:start position:0% that's the idea 01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0% 01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.030 align:start position:0% and and putting them for good use and 01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0% 01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.470 align:start position:0% then yeah and then all of that 01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0% 01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0% computational data that's generated we 01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0% 01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.629 align:start position:0% can then try and learn the functionals 01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0% 01:20:22.639 --> 01:20:24.470 align:start position:0% from that which of course are way more 01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.510 align:start position:0% efficient 01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0% 01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.070 align:start position:0% once we learn the functional than um 01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0% 01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.390 align:start position:0% running those simulations would be 01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0% 01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.110 align:start position:0% do you think one day ai may allow us to 01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0% 01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.830 align:start position:0% do something like basically crack open 01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0% 01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.830 align:start position:0% physics so do something like travel 01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0% 01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.430 align:start position:0% faster than the speed of light 01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0% 01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.590 align:start position:0% my ultimate aim has always been with ai 01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0% 01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.390 align:start position:0% is 01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0% 01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.110 align:start position:0% um the reason i am personally working on 01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0% 01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.669 align:start position:0% ai for my whole life it was to build a 01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0% 01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:49.750 align:start position:0% tool to help us understand stand the 01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0% 01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.550 align:start position:0% universe so i wanted to and that means 01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0% 01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.870 align:start position:0% physics really and the nature of reality 01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0% 01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0% 01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0% 01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.550 align:start position:0% 01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0% 01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.990 align:start position:0% uh i don't think we have systems that 01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0% 01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.750 align:start position:0% are capable of doing that yet but when 01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0% 01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.990 align:start position:0% we get towards agi i think um that's one 01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0% 01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.430 align:start position:0% of the first things i think we should 01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0% 01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.189 align:start position:0% apply agi to 01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:06.550 align:start position:0% i would like to test the limits of 01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0% 01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.390 align:start position:0% physics and our knowledge of physics 01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0% 01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.910 align:start position:0% there's so many things we don't know 01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0% 01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.510 align:start position:0% there's one thing i find fascinating 01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0% 01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.350 align:start position:0% about science and you know as a huge 01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0% 01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.110 align:start position:0% proponent of the scientific method as 01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0% 01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.390 align:start position:0% being one of the greatest ideas 01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0% 01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.470 align:start position:0% humanity's ever had and allowed us to 01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0% 01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.149 align:start position:0% progress with our knowledge 01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0% 01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:22.149 align:start position:0% but i think as a true scientist i think 01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0% 01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:24.470 align:start position:0% what you find is the more you find out 01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.229 align:start position:0% uh you the more you realize we don't 01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0% 01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:26.950 align:start position:0% know 01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0% 01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.030 align:start position:0% and and i always think that it's 01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0% 01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.950 align:start position:0% surprising that more people don't aren't 01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0% 01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.709 align:start position:0% troubled you know every night i think 01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0% 01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:34.550 align:start position:0% about all these things we interact with 01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0% 01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.070 align:start position:0% all the time that we have no idea how 01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0% 01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.830 align:start position:0% they work time 01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0% 01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.070 align:start position:0% consciousness gravity 01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0% 01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.070 align:start position:0% life we can't i mean these are all the 01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0% 01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.149 align:start position:0% fundamental things of nature i think the 01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0% 01:21:44.159 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0% way we don't really know what they are 01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0% 01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.310 align:start position:0% to live life we uh pin certain 01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0% 01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.709 align:start position:0% assumptions on them and kind of treat 01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0% 01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:54.629 align:start position:0% our assumptions as if they're a fact 01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0% 01:21:54.639 --> 01:21:56.950 align:start position:0% yeah that allows us to sort of box them 01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0% 01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.870 align:start position:0% off somehow yeah box them off 01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0% 01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.110 align:start position:0% but the reality is when you think of 01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0% 01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.229 align:start position:0% time 01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0% 01:22:02.239 --> 01:22:04.390 align:start position:0% you should remind yourself you should 01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0% 01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.669 align:start position:0% put it off the sh 01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0% 01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:07.510 align:start position:0% take it off the shelf and realize like 01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0% 01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.870 align:start position:0% no we have a bunch of assumptions 01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0% 01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.709 align:start position:0% there's still a lot of there's even now 01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0% 01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:11.910 align:start position:0% a lot of debate there's a lot of 01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0% 01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.110 align:start position:0% uncertainty about exactly what is time 01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0% 01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.590 align:start position:0% uh is there an error of time you know 01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0% 01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.030 align:start position:0% there's there's a lot of fundamental 01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0% 01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.149 align:start position:0% questions you can't just make 01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0% 01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:22.629 align:start position:0% assumptions about and maybe 01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0% 01:22:22.639 --> 01:22:25.590 align:start position:0% ai allows you to um 01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0% 01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.669 align:start position:0% not put anything on the shelf 01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0% 01:22:27.679 --> 01:22:30.149 align:start position:0% yeah not make any uh hard assumptions 01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0% 01:22:30.159 --> 01:22:31.910 align:start position:0% and really open it up and see what 01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0% 01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.350 align:start position:0% exactly i think we should be truly 01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0% 01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.070 align:start position:0% open-minded about that and uh exactly 01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0% 01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.229 align:start position:0% that not be dogmatic to a particular 01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0% 01:22:38.239 --> 01:22:39.189 align:start position:0% theory 01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0% 01:22:39.199 --> 01:22:42.310 align:start position:0% um it'll also allow us to build better 01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0% 01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.350 align:start position:0% tools experimental tools eventually 01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0% 01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.270 align:start position:0% that can then test certain theories that 01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0% 01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.510 align:start position:0% may not be testable today about as 01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0% 01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.790 align:start position:0% things about like 01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0% 01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.070 align:start position:0% what we spoke about at the beginning 01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0% 01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.590 align:start position:0% about the computational nature of the 01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0% 01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.149 align:start position:0% universe how one might if that was true 01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0% 01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.990 align:start position:0% how one might go about testing that 01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0% 01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.310 align:start position:0% right and and how much uh you know there 01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0% 01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.669 align:start position:0% are people who've conjectured people 01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0% 01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:04.070 align:start position:0% like uh scott aronson and others about 01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0% 01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.149 align:start position:0% uh you know how much information can a 01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0% 01:23:06.159 --> 01:23:08.950 align:start position:0% specific planck unit of space and time 01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0% 01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.870 align:start position:0% contain right so one might be able to 01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0% 01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.270 align:start position:0% think about testing those ideas if you 01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0% 01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.709 align:start position:0% had um 01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0% 01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:18.070 align:start position:0% ai helping you build some new exquisite 01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0% 01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.870 align:start position:0% uh uh experimental tools this is what i 01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0% 01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.790 align:start position:0% imagine you know many decades from now 01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0% 01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0% we'll be able to do 01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0% 01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.669 align:start position:0% and what kind of 01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0% 01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:26.870 align:start position:0% questions can be answered through 01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0% 01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.550 align:start position:0% running a simulation 01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0% 01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.110 align:start position:0% of of them so there's a bunch of physics 01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0% 01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.550 align:start position:0% simulations you can imagine that could 01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0% 01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.510 align:start position:0% be run 01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0% 01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.550 align:start position:0% in an uh so some kind of efficient way 01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0% 01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.390 align:start position:0% much like you're doing in the quantum 01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0% 01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.110 align:start position:0% simulation work 01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0% 01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.110 align:start position:0% and perhaps even the origin of life so 01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0% 01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.790 align:start position:0% figuring out how 01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0% 01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.669 align:start position:0% going even back before the work of alpha 01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0% 01:23:47.679 --> 01:23:49.750 align:start position:0% fault begins of how this whole whole 01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0% 01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.350 align:start position:0% thing 01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0% 01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.629 align:start position:0% um emerges from a rock yes from a static 01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0% 01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:56.629 align:start position:0% thing would what do you do you think ai 01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0% 01:23:56.639 --> 01:23:58.550 align:start position:0% will allow us to is that something you 01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0% 01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.950 align:start position:0% have your eye on it's trying to 01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0% 01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.550 align:start position:0% understand the origin of life first of 01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0% 01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.669 align:start position:0% all yourself 01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0% 01:24:03.679 --> 01:24:05.189 align:start position:0% what do you think 01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:06.229 align:start position:0% 01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0% 01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:08.629 align:start position:0% how the heck did life originate on earth 01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0% 01:24:08.639 --> 01:24:10.550 align:start position:0% yeah well maybe we i'll come to that in 01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0% 01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.870 align:start position:0% a second but i think the ultimate 01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0% 01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.870 align:start position:0% use of ai is to 01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0% 01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.030 align:start position:0% kind of use it to accelerate science to 01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0% 01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.430 align:start position:0% the maximum so i 01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0% 01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.270 align:start position:0% um think of it a little bit like the 01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0% 01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.950 align:start position:0% tree of all knowledge if you imagine 01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.229 align:start position:0% that's all the knowledge there is in the 01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0% 01:24:24.239 --> 01:24:25.750 align:start position:0% universe to attain 01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0% 01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.669 align:start position:0% and we sort of barely scratched the 01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0% 01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:30.070 align:start position:0% surface of that so far in even though 01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0% 01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.830 align:start position:0% you know we've we've done pretty well 01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0% 01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.189 align:start position:0% since the enlightenment right as 01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0% 01:24:33.199 --> 01:24:35.910 align:start position:0% humanity and i think ai will turbo 01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0% 01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.430 align:start position:0% charge all of that like we've seen with 01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0% 01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.149 align:start position:0% alpha fold and i want to explore as much 01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0% 01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.590 align:start position:0% of that tree of knowledge as it's 01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0% 01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.790 align:start position:0% possible to do and um and i think that 01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0% 01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.189 align:start position:0% involves ai helping us with with with 01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0% 01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:49.669 align:start position:0% understanding or finding patterns um but 01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0% 01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:51.590 align:start position:0% also potentially designing and building 01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0% 01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.830 align:start position:0% new tools experimental tools so i think 01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0% 01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.910 align:start position:0% that's all uh 01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0% 01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.510 align:start position:0% and also running simulations and 01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0% 01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.510 align:start position:0% learning simulations all of that we're 01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0% 01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.390 align:start position:0% already we're sort of doing it at a at a 01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0% 01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.030 align:start position:0% at a you know baby steps level here but 01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0% 01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.669 align:start position:0% i can imagine that in in in the decades 01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0% 01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:10.310 align:start position:0% to come as uh you know what's the full 01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0% 01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.790 align:start position:0% flourishing of of that line of thinking 01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0% 01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.390 align:start position:0% it's going to be truly incredible i 01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.310 align:start position:0% would say if i visualize this tree of 01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0% 01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.629 align:start position:0% knowledge something tells me that that 01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0% 01:25:18.639 --> 01:25:20.310 align:start position:0% knowledge for tree of knowledge for 01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0% 01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.790 align:start position:0% humans is much smaller 01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0% 01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.470 align:start position:0% in the set of all possible trees of 01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.110 align:start position:0% knowledge is actually quite small giving 01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0% 01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.870 align:start position:0% our cognitive 01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0% 01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.590 align:start position:0% limitations 01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0% 01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.070 align:start position:0% limited cognitive capabilities that even 01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0% 01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.910 align:start position:0% with with the tools we build we still 01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0% 01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.270 align:start position:0% won't be able to understand a lot of 01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0% 01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.550 align:start position:0% things and that's perhaps what non-human 01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0% 01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.709 align:start position:0% systems might be able to reach farther 01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0% 01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:44.790 align:start position:0% not just as tools 01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0% 01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.629 align:start position:0% but in themselves understanding 01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0% 01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:48.870 align:start position:0% something that they can bring back yeah 01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0% 01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.030 align:start position:0% it could well be so i mean there's so 01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0% 01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.270 align:start position:0% many things that that are sort of 01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0% 01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.870 align:start position:0% encapsulated in what you just said there 01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0% 01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.189 align:start position:0% i think first of all um 01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0% 01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:58.149 align:start position:0% there's there's two different things 01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0% 01:25:58.159 --> 01:25:59.910 align:start position:0% there's like what do we understand today 01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0% 01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.669 align:start position:0% yeah what could the human mind 01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0% 01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:03.910 align:start position:0% understand and what is the totality of 01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0% 01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.750 align:start position:0% what is there to be understood yeah 01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0% 01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.390 align:start position:0% right and so there's three consensus you 01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0% 01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.590 align:start position:0% know you can think of them as three 01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0% 01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.110 align:start position:0% larger and larger trees or exploring 01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0% 01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.430 align:start position:0% more branches of that tree and i i think 01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0% 01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.950 align:start position:0% with ai we're going to explore that 01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0% 01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.830 align:start position:0% whole lot now the question is is uh you 01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0% 01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.750 align:start position:0% know if you think about what is the 01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0% 01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.550 align:start position:0% totality of what could be understood um 01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0% 01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.310 align:start position:0% there may be some fundamental physics 01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.750 align:start position:0% reasons why certain things can't be 01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0% 01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.110 align:start position:0% understood like what's outside the 01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0% 01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.430 align:start position:0% simulation or outside the universe maybe 01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0% 01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.110 align:start position:0% it's not understandable from within the 01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.120 align:start position:0% 01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.149 align:start position:0% universe 01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0% 01:26:32.159 --> 01:26:33.510 align:start position:0% so that's there may be some hard 01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0% 01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.950 align:start position:0% constraints like that you know it could 01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0% 01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.870 align:start position:0% be smaller constraints like 01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0% 01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.149 align:start position:0% um we think of space time as fundamental 01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0% 01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:42.229 align:start position:0% us our human brains are really used to 01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0% 01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:43.910 align:start position:0% this idea of a three-dimensional world 01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0% 01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.270 align:start position:0% with time right 01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0% 01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.669 align:start position:0% maybe but our tools could go beyond that 01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0% 01:26:47.679 --> 01:26:49.189 align:start position:0% they wouldn't have that limitation 01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0% 01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:50.629 align:start position:0% necessary they could think in 11 01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0% 01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.149 align:start position:0% dimensions 12 dimensions whatever is 01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0% 01:26:52.159 --> 01:26:54.550 align:start position:0% needed but um we could still maybe 01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0% 01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.310 align:start position:0% understand that in several different 01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0% 01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.870 align:start position:0% ways the example i always give is um 01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0% 01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.790 align:start position:0% when i you know play gary kasparov at 01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.550 align:start position:0% speed chess or we've talked about chess 01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0% 01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.790 align:start position:0% and these kind of things um you know he 01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0% 01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.550 align:start position:0% if you if you if you're reasonably good 01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0% 01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.510 align:start position:0% at chess you can um you can't come up 01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0% 01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.430 align:start position:0% with the move gary comes up with in his 01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0% 01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.350 align:start position:0% move but he can explain it to you and 01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0% 01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.310 align:start position:0% you can understand and you can 01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0% 01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.709 align:start position:0% understand post hoc the reasoning yeah 01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0% 01:27:16.719 --> 01:27:18.470 align:start position:0% so so i think there's a there's an even 01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0% 01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.910 align:start position:0% further level of like well maybe you 01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0% 01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.750 align:start position:0% couldn't have invented that thing but 01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0% 01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0% but using like going back to using 01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0% 01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.950 align:start position:0% language again perhaps you can 01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0% 01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.350 align:start position:0% understand and appreciate that same way 01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0% 01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.430 align:start position:0% like you can appreciate you know vivaldi 01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0% 01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.350 align:start position:0% or mozart or something without you can 01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0% 01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.510 align:start position:0% appreciate the beauty of that without um 01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0% 01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.510 align:start position:0% being able to to construct it yourself 01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0% 01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.510 align:start position:0% right invent the music yourself so i 01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0% 01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.189 align:start position:0% think we see this in all forms of life 01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0% 01:27:39.199 --> 01:27:41.510 align:start position:0% so it'll be that times you know 01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0% 01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.750 align:start position:0% a million but it would you can imagine 01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0% 01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.070 align:start position:0% also one sign of intelligence is the 01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0% 01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.070 align:start position:0% ability to explain things clearly and 01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0% 01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.750 align:start position:0% simply right you know people like 01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0% 01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:50.870 align:start position:0% richard feynman another one of my 01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0% 01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.310 align:start position:0% all-time heroes used to say that right 01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0% 01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.070 align:start position:0% if you can't you know if you can explain 01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0% 01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.149 align:start position:0% it something simply then you that's a 01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0% 01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:58.149 align:start position:0% that's the best sign a complex topic 01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0% 01:27:58.159 --> 01:27:59.430 align:start position:0% simply then that's one of the best signs 01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0% 01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.590 align:start position:0% of you understanding it yeah so i can 01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0% 01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.270 align:start position:0% see myself talking trash in the ai 01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0% 01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.590 align:start position:0% system in that way yes uh 01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0% 01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.229 align:start position:0% it gets frustrated how dumb i am and 01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0% 01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:09.910 align:start position:0% trying to explain something to me i was 01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0% 01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.950 align:start position:0% like well that means you're not 01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0% 01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.070 align:start position:0% intelligent because if you were 01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0% 01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.590 align:start position:0% intelligent you'd be able to explain it 01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0% 01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.750 align:start position:0% simply yeah of course you know there's 01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0% 01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.189 align:start position:0% also the other option of course we could 01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0% 01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:18.950 align:start position:0% enhance ourselves and and without 01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0% 01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.030 align:start position:0% devices we we are already sort of 01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0% 01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.189 align:start position:0% symbiotic with our compute devices right 01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0% 01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:25.030 align:start position:0% with our phones and other things and you 01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0% 01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.030 align:start position:0% know this stuff like neural link and etc 01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0% 01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.709 align:start position:0% that could be could could advance that 01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0% 01:28:28.719 --> 01:28:31.270 align:start position:0% further um so i think there's lots of 01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0% 01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.510 align:start position:0% lots of really amazing possibilities uh 01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0% 01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.510 align:start position:0% that i could foresee from here well let 01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0% 01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.270 align:start position:0% me ask you some wild questions so out 01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0% 01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.070 align:start position:0% there 01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0% 01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0% looking for friends 01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0% 01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.189 align:start position:0% do you think there's a lot of alien 01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0% 01:28:41.199 --> 01:28:43.030 align:start position:0% civilizations out there 01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0% 01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.110 align:start position:0% so i guess this also goes back to your 01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0% 01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.870 align:start position:0% origin of life question too because i 01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0% 01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.310 align:start position:0% think that that's key 01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0% 01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.270 align:start position:0% 01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0% 01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.350 align:start position:0% my personal opinion looking at all this 01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0% 01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.790 align:start position:0% and and you know it's one of my hobbies 01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0% 01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.750 align:start position:0% physics i guess so so i i you know it's 01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0% 01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.110 align:start position:0% something i think about a lot and talk 01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0% 01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.590 align:start position:0% to a lot of experts on and and and read 01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0% 01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.070 align:start position:0% a lot of books on and i think 01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0% 01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.310 align:start position:0% my feeling currently is that that we are 01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0% 01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.629 align:start position:0% alone i think that's the most likely 01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0% 01:29:06.639 --> 01:29:08.470 align:start position:0% scenario given what what evidence we 01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0% 01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.510 align:start position:0% have so um and the reasoning is i think 01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0% 01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.870 align:start position:0% 01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0% 01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.950 align:start position:0% you know we've tried since uh things 01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0% 01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.110 align:start position:0% like seti program and i guess since the 01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0% 01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.070 align:start position:0% dawning of the the space age uh we've 01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0% 01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.750 align:start position:0% you know had telescopes open radio 01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0% 01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.070 align:start position:0% telescopes and other things and if you 01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0% 01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.189 align:start position:0% think about um and try to detect signals 01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0% 01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:28.870 align:start position:0% now if you think about the evolution of 01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0% 01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.189 align:start position:0% humans on earth we could have easily 01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0% 01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.390 align:start position:0% been um a million years ahead of our 01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0% 01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.470 align:start position:0% time now or million years behind quite 01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0% 01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.709 align:start position:0% easily with just some slightly different 01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0% 01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:40.629 align:start position:0% quirk thing happening hundreds of 01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0% 01:29:40.639 --> 01:29:42.550 align:start position:0% thousands years ago uh you know things 01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0% 01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.669 align:start position:0% could have been slightly different if 01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0% 01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:45.590 align:start position:0% the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million 01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0% 01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.790 align:start position:0% years earlier maybe things would have 01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0% 01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.590 align:start position:0% evolved uh we'd be a million years 01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0% 01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.270 align:start position:0% ahead of where we are now so what that 01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0% 01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.350 align:start position:0% means is if you imagine where humanity 01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0% 01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.830 align:start position:0% will be in a few hundred years let alone 01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0% 01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.910 align:start position:0% a million years especially if we 01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0% 01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.510 align:start position:0% hopefully um 01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0% 01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.790 align:start position:0% you know solve things like climate 01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.790 align:start position:0% change and other things and we continue 01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0% 01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.070 align:start position:0% to flourish 01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0% 01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.990 align:start position:0% and we build things like ai and we do 01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0% 01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.830 align:start position:0% space traveling and all of the stuff 01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0% 01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.990 align:start position:0% that that humans have dreamed of for 01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0% 01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.750 align:start position:0% forever right and sci-fi has talked 01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0% 01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.310 align:start position:0% about forever um 01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0% 01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.390 align:start position:0% we will be spreading across the stars 01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0% 01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.149 align:start position:0% right and void neumann famously 01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0% 01:30:18.159 --> 01:30:19.830 align:start position:0% calculated you know it would only take 01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0% 01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.270 align:start position:0% about a million years if you send out 01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0% 01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.270 align:start position:0% von neumann probes to the nearest you 01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0% 01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.270 align:start position:0% know the nearest uh uh other solar 01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0% 01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.510 align:start position:0% systems and and then they built all they 01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0% 01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.030 align:start position:0% did was build two more versions of 01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0% 01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.550 align:start position:0% themselves and set those two out to the 01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0% 01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.550 align:start position:0% next nearest systems uh you you know 01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0% 01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.910 align:start position:0% within a million years i think you would 01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0% 01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.750 align:start position:0% have one of these probes in every system 01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0% 01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.310 align:start position:0% in the galaxy so it's not actually in 01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0% 01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.310 align:start position:0% cosmo cosmological time that's actually 01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0% 01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.990 align:start position:0% a very short amount of time 01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0% 01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.750 align:start position:0% so and and you know we've people like 01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0% 01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.510 align:start position:0% dyson have thought about constructing 01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0% 01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.669 align:start position:0% dyson spheres around stars to collect 01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0% 01:30:47.679 --> 01:30:49.669 align:start position:0% all the energy coming out of the star 01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0% 01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:50.790 align:start position:0% you know that there would be 01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0% 01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.390 align:start position:0% constructions like that would be visible 01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0% 01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.030 align:start position:0% across base um probably even across a 01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0% 01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.590 align:start position:0% galaxy so and then you know if you think 01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0% 01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.149 align:start position:0% about all of our radio television uh 01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0% 01:31:00.159 --> 01:31:02.149 align:start position:0% emissions that have gone out since since 01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0% 01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:05.510 align:start position:0% the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a 01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0% 01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.310 align:start position:0% million years of that and now hundreds 01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0% 01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.229 align:start position:0% of civilizations doing that when we 01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0% 01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:12.629 align:start position:0% opened our ears at the point we got 01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0% 01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:14.790 align:start position:0% technologically sophisticated enough in 01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0% 01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.110 align:start position:0% the space age we should have 01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0% 01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.189 align:start position:0% heard a cacophony of voices we should 01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0% 01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:20.870 align:start position:0% have joined that cacophony of voices and 01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0% 01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.950 align:start position:0% what we did we opened our ears and we 01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.390 align:start position:0% heard nothing 01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0% 01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.550 align:start position:0% and many people who argue that there are 01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0% 01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.229 align:start position:0% aliens would say well we haven't really 01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0% 01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:30.390 align:start position:0% done exhaustive search yet and maybe 01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0% 01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.390 align:start position:0% we're looking in the wrong bands and and 01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0% 01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.830 align:start position:0% we've got the wrong devices and we 01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0% 01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.750 align:start position:0% wouldn't notice what an alien form was 01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0% 01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.270 align:start position:0% like to be so different to what we're 01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0% 01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.430 align:start position:0% used to but you know i'm not i don't 01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0% 01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.510 align:start position:0% really buy that that it shouldn't be as 01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0% 01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.350 align:start position:0% difficult as that like we i think we've 01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0% 01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.950 align:start position:0% searched enough there should be if it 01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0% 01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.470 align:start position:0% were everywhere if it was it should be 01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0% 01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.550 align:start position:0% everywhere we should see dyson's fears 01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0% 01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.470 align:start position:0% being put up sun's blinking in and out 01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0% 01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.510 align:start position:0% you know there should be a lot of 01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0% 01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.110 align:start position:0% evidence for those things and then there 01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0% 01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.790 align:start position:0% are other people argue well the sort of 01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0% 01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.550 align:start position:0% safari view of like well we're a 01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0% 01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.830 align:start position:0% primitive species still because we're 01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0% 01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.990 align:start position:0% not space faring yet and and and we're 01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0% 01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.510 align:start position:0% you know there's some kind of globe like 01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0% 01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.669 align:start position:0% universal rule not to interfere star 01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0% 01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:05.750 align:start position:0% trek rule but like look look we can't 01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0% 01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.669 align:start position:0% even coordinate humans to deal with 01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0% 01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:10.229 align:start position:0% climate change and we're one species 01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0% 01:32:10.239 --> 01:32:11.990 align:start position:0% what is the chance that of all of these 01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0% 01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.669 align:start position:0% different human civilization you know 01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0% 01:32:13.679 --> 01:32:15.270 align:start position:0% alien civilizations they would have the 01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0% 01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.070 align:start position:0% same priorities and and and and agree 01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0% 01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.070 align:start position:0% across you know these kind of matters 01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0% 01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.310 align:start position:0% and even if that was true and we were in 01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0% 01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.110 align:start position:0% some sort of safari for our own good to 01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0% 01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.390 align:start position:0% me that's not much different from the 01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0% 01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.990 align:start position:0% simulation hypothesis because what does 01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0% 01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.750 align:start position:0% it mean the simulation hypothesis i 01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0% 01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.350 align:start position:0% think in its most fundamental level it 01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0% 01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.750 align:start position:0% means what we're seeing is not quite 01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0% 01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.590 align:start position:0% reality right it's something there's 01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0% 01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.590 align:start position:0% something more deeper underlying it 01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0% 01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.149 align:start position:0% maybe computational now if we were in a 01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0% 01:32:40.159 --> 01:32:42.629 align:start position:0% if we were in a sort of safari park and 01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0% 01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:44.229 align:start position:0% everything we were seeing was a hologram 01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0% 01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.910 align:start position:0% and it was projected by the aliens or 01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0% 01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.270 align:start position:0% whatever that to me is not much 01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0% 01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.110 align:start position:0% different than thinking we're inside of 01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0% 01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.870 align:start position:0% another universe because we still can't 01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0% 01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.430 align:start position:0% see true reality right i mean there's 01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0% 01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.510 align:start position:0% there's other explanations it could be 01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0% 01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.709 align:start position:0% 01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0% 01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:58.070 align:start position:0% the way they're communicating is just 01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0% 01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.750 align:start position:0% fundamentally different that we're too 01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0% 01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.910 align:start position:0% dumb to understand the much better 01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0% 01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.910 align:start position:0% methods of communication they have it 01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0% 01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.470 align:start position:0% could be i mean i mean it's silly to say 01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0% 01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.350 align:start position:0% but 01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0% 01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.990 align:start position:0% our own thoughts could be the methods by 01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0% 01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.910 align:start position:0% which they're communicating like the 01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0% 01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.669 align:start position:0% place from which our ideas writers talk 01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0% 01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:17.189 align:start position:0% about this like the muse yeah 01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0% 01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:20.229 align:start position:0% it sounds like very kind of uh 01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0% 01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:22.229 align:start position:0% wild but it could be thoughts it could 01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0% 01:33:22.239 --> 01:33:22.950 align:start position:0% be 01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.430 align:start position:0% some interactions with our mind that we 01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0% 01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.430 align:start position:0% think are originating from 01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0% 01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.709 align:start position:0% us is actually something that uh 01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0% 01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:32.470 align:start position:0% is coming from other life forms 01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0% 01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.390 align:start position:0% elsewhere consciousness itself might be 01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0% 01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.390 align:start position:0% that it could be but i don't see any 01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0% 01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.390 align:start position:0% sensible argument to the why why would 01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0% 01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:41.189 align:start position:0% all of the alien species be using this 01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0% 01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:42.550 align:start position:0% way yes some of them will be more 01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0% 01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.910 align:start position:0% primitive they would be close to our 01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0% 01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.750 align:start position:0% level you know there would there should 01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0% 01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.590 align:start position:0% be a whole sort of normal distribution 01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0% 01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.030 align:start position:0% of these things right some would be 01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0% 01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.430 align:start position:0% aggressive some would be you know 01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0% 01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.229 align:start position:0% curious others would be very stoical and 01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0% 01:33:54.239 --> 01:33:56.070 align:start position:0% philosophical because you know maybe 01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0% 01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0% they're a million years older than us 01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0% 01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.149 align:start position:0% but it's not it shouldn't be like what i 01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0% 01:34:00.159 --> 01:34:02.390 align:start position:0% mean one one alien civilization might be 01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0% 01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.830 align:start position:0% like that communicating thoughts and 01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0% 01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.669 align:start position:0% others but i don't see why you know 01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0% 01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:07.669 align:start position:0% potentially the hundreds there should be 01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0% 01:34:07.679 --> 01:34:09.990 align:start position:0% would be uniform in this way right it 01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0% 01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.070 align:start position:0% could be a violent dictatorship that the 01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0% 01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.189 align:start position:0% the people the alien civilizations that 01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0% 01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:17.669 align:start position:0% uh become successful 01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0% 01:34:17.679 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0% become um 01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:18.770 align:start position:0% 01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:20.550 align:start position:0% [Music] 01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0% 01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.189 align:start position:0% gain the ability to be destructive an 01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0% 01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.910 align:start position:0% order of magnitude more destructive 01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0% 01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.830 align:start position:0% but of course the the sad thought 01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0% 01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:30.629 align:start position:0% well 01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0% 01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:33.189 align:start position:0% either humans are very special we took a 01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0% 01:34:33.199 --> 01:34:35.669 align:start position:0% lot of leaps that arrived at what it 01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0% 01:34:35.679 --> 01:34:37.750 align:start position:0% means to be human yeah 01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0% 01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.629 align:start position:0% 01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0% 01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.470 align:start position:0% there's a question there which was the 01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0% 01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.790 align:start position:0% hardest which was the most special but 01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0% 01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:45.109 align:start position:0% also if others have reached this level 01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0% 01:34:45.119 --> 01:34:46.629 align:start position:0% and maybe many others have reached this 01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0% 01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:47.750 align:start position:0% 01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0% 01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.310 align:start position:0% the great filter 01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0% 01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.790 align:start position:0% that prevented them from going farther 01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0% 01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.109 align:start position:0% to becoming a multi-planetary species or 01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0% 01:34:55.119 --> 01:34:57.669 align:start position:0% reaching out into the stars 01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0% 01:34:57.679 --> 01:34:59.590 align:start position:0% and those are really important questions 01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0% 01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.350 align:start position:0% for us whether 01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0% 01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.310 align:start position:0% 01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0% 01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.430 align:start position:0% whether there's other alien 01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0% 01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.109 align:start position:0% civilizations out there or not this is 01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0% 01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:07.430 align:start position:0% very useful for us to think about if we 01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0% 01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.109 align:start position:0% destroy ourselves 01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0% 01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:11.590 align:start position:0% how will we do it and how easy is it to 01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0% 01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.910 align:start position:0% do yeah well you know these are big 01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0% 01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.270 align:start position:0% questions and i've thought about these a 01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0% 01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.109 align:start position:0% lot but the the the interesting thing is 01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0% 01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:19.669 align:start position:0% that if we're if we're alone 01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0% 01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:21.030 align:start position:0% that's somewhat comforting from the 01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0% 01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.629 align:start position:0% great filter perspective because it 01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0% 01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:24.310 align:start position:0% probably means the great filters were 01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.390 align:start position:0% are past us and i'm pretty sure they are 01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0% 01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.070 align:start position:0% so that by in going back to your origin 01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0% 01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.830 align:start position:0% of life question there are some 01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0% 01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0% incredible things that no one knows how 01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0% 01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.430 align:start position:0% happened like obviously the first 01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0% 01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.070 align:start position:0% life form from chemical soup that seems 01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0% 01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.990 align:start position:0% pretty hard but i would guess the 01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0% 01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.590 align:start position:0% multicellular i wouldn't be that 01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0% 01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.750 align:start position:0% surprised if we saw single 01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0% 01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.910 align:start position:0% single cell sort of life forms elsewhere 01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0% 01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.910 align:start position:0% uh bacteria type things but 01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0% 01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.149 align:start position:0% multicellular life seems incredibly hard 01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0% 01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.510 align:start position:0% that step of you know capturing 01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0% 01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.910 align:start position:0% mitochondria and then sort of using that 01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0% 01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.590 align:start position:0% as part of yourself you know when you've 01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0% 01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.030 align:start position:0% just eaten it would you say that's the 01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0% 01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.390 align:start position:0% biggest 01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0% 01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.109 align:start position:0% the most uh like 01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0% 01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:01.510 align:start position:0% if if you had to choose one sort of uh 01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0% 01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.270 align:start position:0% hitchhiker's got this galaxy one 01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0% 01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.149 align:start position:0% sentence summary of like oh those clever 01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0% 01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:07.910 align:start position:0% creatures did this that would be the 01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0% 01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.590 align:start position:0% multilist i think that was probably the 01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0% 01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.950 align:start position:0% one that that's the biggest i mean 01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0% 01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.550 align:start position:0% there's a great book called the 10 grand 01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0% 01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.629 align:start position:0% great inventions of evolution by nick 01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0% 01:36:14.639 --> 01:36:17.189 align:start position:0% lane and he speculates on 10 10 of these 01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0% 01:36:17.199 --> 01:36:19.910 align:start position:0% you know what could be great filters um 01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0% 01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.510 align:start position:0% i think that's one i think the the 01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0% 01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.229 align:start position:0% advent of of intelligence and and 01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0% 01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:25.990 align:start position:0% conscious intelligence and in order you 01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0% 01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.510 align:start position:0% know to us to be able to do science and 01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0% 01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.990 align:start position:0% things like that is huge as well i mean 01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0% 01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.910 align:start position:0% it's only evolved once as far as you 01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0% 01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.350 align:start position:0% know uh in in earth history so that 01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0% 01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.669 align:start position:0% would be a later candidate but there's 01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0% 01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:39.030 align:start position:0% certainly for the early candidates i 01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0% 01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.270 align:start position:0% think multicellular life forms is huge 01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0% 01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.790 align:start position:0% by the way what it's interesting to ask 01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0% 01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.669 align:start position:0% you if you can hypothesize about 01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0% 01:36:45.679 --> 01:36:48.390 align:start position:0% what is the origin of intelligence is it 01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0% 01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.430 align:start position:0% 01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0% 01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.030 align:start position:0% that we started 01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0% 01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.510 align:start position:0% cooking meat over fire 01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0% 01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.510 align:start position:0% is it that we somehow figured out that 01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0% 01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.350 align:start position:0% we could be very powerful when we start 01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0% 01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.790 align:start position:0% collaborating so cooperation between 01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.430 align:start position:0% um our ancestors 01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0% 01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.229 align:start position:0% so that we can overthrow the alpha male 01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0% 01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:07.990 align:start position:0% uh what is it richard i talked to 01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0% 01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.590 align:start position:0% richard randham who thinks we're all 01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0% 01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.430 align:start position:0% just beta males who figured out how to 01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0% 01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.830 align:start position:0% collaborate to defeat the one the 01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0% 01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.709 align:start position:0% dictator the authoritarian alpha male 01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0% 01:37:16.719 --> 01:37:19.350 align:start position:0% um that control the tribe um is there 01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0% 01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.709 align:start position:0% other explanation did was there um 2001 01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0% 01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:24.790 align:start position:0% space out any type of monolith yeah that 01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0% 01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.109 align:start position:0% came down to earth well i i think um i 01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0% 01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:28.310 align:start position:0% think all of those things you suggest 01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0% 01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.470 align:start position:0% for good candidates fire and and and 01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0% 01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.310 align:start position:0% cooking right so that's clearly 01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0% 01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.149 align:start position:0% important 01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0% 01:37:34.159 --> 01:37:36.390 align:start position:0% you know energy efficiency yeah cooking 01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0% 01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:38.870 align:start position:0% our meat and then and then being able to 01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0% 01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.870 align:start position:0% to to be more efficient about eating it 01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0% 01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.350 align:start position:0% and getting it consuming the energy um i 01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0% 01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.109 align:start position:0% think that's huge and then utilizing 01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0% 01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0% fire and tools i think you're right 01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0% 01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.030 align:start position:0% about the the tribal cooperation aspects 01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0% 01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.629 align:start position:0% and probably language as part of that 01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0% 01:37:50.639 --> 01:37:52.390 align:start position:0% yes um because probably that's what 01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0% 01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.070 align:start position:0% allowed us to outcompete neanderthals 01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0% 01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.629 align:start position:0% and and perhaps less cooperative species 01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0% 01:37:56.639 --> 01:37:59.430 align:start position:0% so um so that may be the case tool 01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0% 01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.870 align:start position:0% making spears axes i think that let us i 01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0% 01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.470 align:start position:0% mean i think it's pretty clear now that 01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0% 01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.990 align:start position:0% humans were responsible for a lot of the 01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0% 01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.629 align:start position:0% extinctions of megafauna um especially 01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0% 01:38:08.639 --> 01:38:11.270 align:start position:0% in in the americas when humans arrived 01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0% 01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.070 align:start position:0% so uh you can imagine once you discover 01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0% 01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.830 align:start position:0% tool usage how powerful that would have 01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0% 01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.070 align:start position:0% been and how scary for animals so i 01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0% 01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.510 align:start position:0% think all of those could have been 01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0% 01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.270 align:start position:0% explanations for it you know the 01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0% 01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.109 align:start position:0% interesting thing is that it's a bit 01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0% 01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:25.030 align:start position:0% like general intelligence too is it's 01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0% 01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.430 align:start position:0% very costly to begin with to have a 01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0% 01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.390 align:start position:0% brain 01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0% 01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.830 align:start position:0% and especially a general purpose brain 01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0% 01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.189 align:start position:0% rather than a special purpose one 01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0% 01:38:31.199 --> 01:38:32.470 align:start position:0% because the amount of energy our brains 01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0% 01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.070 align:start position:0% use i think it's like 20 of the body's 01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0% 01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.310 align:start position:0% energy and it's it's massive and when 01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0% 01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.830 align:start position:0% you're thinking chest one of the funny 01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0% 01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.830 align:start position:0% things that that we used to say is as 01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0% 01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.470 align:start position:0% much as a racing driver uses for a whole 01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0% 01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.070 align:start position:0% you know formula one race if just 01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0% 01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.669 align:start position:0% playing a game of you know serious high 01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0% 01:38:45.679 --> 01:38:46.870 align:start position:0% level chess which you you know you 01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0% 01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.109 align:start position:0% wouldn't think just sitting there um 01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0% 01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:51.189 align:start position:0% because the brain's using so much uh 01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0% 01:38:51.199 --> 01:38:53.189 align:start position:0% energy so in order for an animal an 01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:55.750 align:start position:0% organism to justify that there has to be 01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0% 01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.109 align:start position:0% a huge payoff and the problem with with 01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0% 01:38:59.119 --> 01:39:01.910 align:start position:0% half a brain or half you know 01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0% 01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.189 align:start position:0% intelligence saying iqs of you know 01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:07.510 align:start position:0% of like a monkey brain it's 01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0% 01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.510 align:start position:0% it's not clear you can justify that 01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0% 01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.270 align:start position:0% evolutionary until you get to the human 01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0% 01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.510 align:start position:0% level brain and so but how do you how do 01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0% 01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.270 align:start position:0% you do that jump it's very difficult 01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0% 01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.709 align:start position:0% which is why i think it's only been done 01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0% 01:39:16.719 --> 01:39:18.470 align:start position:0% once from the sort of specialized brains 01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0% 01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.629 align:start position:0% that you see in animals to this sort of 01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0% 01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0% general purpose chewing powerful brains 01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0% 01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.189 align:start position:0% that humans have um and which allows us 01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0% 01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:30.149 align:start position:0% to invent the modern modern world um and 01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0% 01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:32.709 align:start position:0% uh you know it takes a lot to to cross 01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0% 01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:34.310 align:start position:0% that barrier and i think we've seen the 01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0% 01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.550 align:start position:0% same with ai systems which is that uh 01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0% 01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.629 align:start position:0% maybe until very recently it's always 01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0% 01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.790 align:start position:0% been easier to craft a specific solution 01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0% 01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.870 align:start position:0% to a problem like chess than it has been 01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0% 01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.470 align:start position:0% to build a general learning system that 01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0% 01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.310 align:start position:0% could potentially do many things because 01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0% 01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.629 align:start position:0% initially uh that system will be way 01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0% 01:39:48.639 --> 01:39:51.030 align:start position:0% worse than uh less efficient than the 01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0% 01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.629 align:start position:0% specialized system so one of the 01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0% 01:39:52.639 --> 01:39:53.750 align:start position:0% interesting 01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0% 01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.590 align:start position:0% quirks of the human mind of this evolved 01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0% 01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.830 align:start position:0% system is that it appears to be 01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0% 01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.189 align:start position:0% conscious 01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0% 01:40:01.199 --> 01:40:02.310 align:start position:0% this thing that we don't quite 01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0% 01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.430 align:start position:0% understand but it seems very 01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0% 01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.590 align:start position:0% very special its ability to have a 01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0% 01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.510 align:start position:0% subjective experience that it feels like 01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0% 01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.950 align:start position:0% something 01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0% 01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.350 align:start position:0% to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it 01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0% 01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.510 align:start position:0% or see a color and that kind of stuff do 01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0% 01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.830 align:start position:0% you think in order to solve intelligence 01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0% 01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.590 align:start position:0% we also need to solve consciousness 01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0% 01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.229 align:start position:0% along the way do you think agi systems 01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0% 01:40:22.239 --> 01:40:25.270 align:start position:0% need to have consciousness in order to 01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0% 01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.310 align:start position:0% 01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0% 01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.629 align:start position:0% truly intelligent yeah we thought about 01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0% 01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:31.750 align:start position:0% this a lot actually and um i think that 01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0% 01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.430 align:start position:0% my guess is that consciousness and 01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0% 01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.830 align:start position:0% intelligence are double dissociable so 01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0% 01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.430 align:start position:0% you can have one without the other both 01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0% 01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.149 align:start position:0% ways and i think you can see that with 01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0% 01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:42.070 align:start position:0% consciousness in that i think some 01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0% 01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.950 align:start position:0% animals and pets if you have a pet dog 01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0% 01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.870 align:start position:0% or something like that you can see some 01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0% 01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.390 align:start position:0% of the higher animals and dolphins 01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0% 01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.310 align:start position:0% things like that are uh have 01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0% 01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.550 align:start position:0% self-awareness and uh very sociable um 01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0% 01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.189 align:start position:0% seem to dream um you know those kinds of 01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0% 01:40:57.199 --> 01:40:59.030 align:start position:0% a lot of the traits one would regard as 01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0% 01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.669 align:start position:0% being kind of conscious and self-aware 01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0% 01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:04.229 align:start position:0% um and but yet they're not that smart 01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0% 01:41:04.239 --> 01:41:06.229 align:start position:0% right uh so they're not that intelligent 01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0% 01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:08.550 align:start position:0% by by say iq standards or something like 01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0% 01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.470 align:start position:0% that yeah it's also possible that our 01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0% 01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.790 align:start position:0% understanding of intelligence is flawed 01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0% 01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:15.270 align:start position:0% like putting an iq to it sure maybe the 01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0% 01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.270 align:start position:0% thing that a dog can do 01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0% 01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.830 align:start position:0% is actually gone very far along the path 01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0% 01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.430 align:start position:0% of intelligence and we humans are just 01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0% 01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.390 align:start position:0% able to 01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0% 01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.950 align:start position:0% play chess and maybe write poems right 01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0% 01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.950 align:start position:0% but if we go back to the idea of agi and 01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0% 01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.390 align:start position:0% general intelligence you know dogs are 01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0% 01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.990 align:start position:0% very specialized right most animals are 01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0% 01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.430 align:start position:0% pretty specialized they can be amazing 01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0% 01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.189 align:start position:0% at what they do but they're like kind of 01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0% 01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:35.510 align:start position:0% elite sports sports people or something 01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0% 01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.669 align:start position:0% right so they do one thing extremely 01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0% 01:41:37.679 --> 01:41:39.430 align:start position:0% well because their entire brain is is 01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0% 01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.189 align:start position:0% optimized they have somehow convinced 01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0% 01:41:41.199 --> 01:41:43.030 align:start position:0% the entirety of the human population to 01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0% 01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.950 align:start position:0% feed them and service them so in some 01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0% 01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.109 align:start position:0% way they're controlling yes exactly well 01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0% 01:41:47.119 --> 01:41:49.590 align:start position:0% we co-evolved to some crazy degree right 01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0% 01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.590 align:start position:0% uh including the the way the dogs you 01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0% 01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.830 align:start position:0% know even even wag their tails and 01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0% 01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.590 align:start position:0% twitch their noses right we find we're 01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0% 01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.790 align:start position:0% finding inexorably cute yeah um but i 01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0% 01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.030 align:start position:0% think um you can also see intelligence 01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0% 01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.629 align:start position:0% on the other side so systems like 01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0% 01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:05.350 align:start position:0% artificial systems that are amazingly 01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0% 01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.510 align:start position:0% smart at certain things like maybe 01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0% 01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.590 align:start position:0% playing go and chess and other things 01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0% 01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.310 align:start position:0% but they don't feel at all in any shape 01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0% 01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.550 align:start position:0% or form conscious in the way that you 01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0% 01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.550 align:start position:0% know you do to me or i do to you and um 01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0% 01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:19.990 align:start position:0% and i think actually 01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0% 01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.350 align:start position:0% building ai 01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0% 01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.229 align:start position:0% is uh these intelligent constructs uh is 01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0% 01:42:24.239 --> 01:42:25.830 align:start position:0% one of the best ways to explore the 01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0% 01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.270 align:start position:0% mystery of consciousness to break it 01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0% 01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:30.149 align:start position:0% down because um we're going to have 01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0% 01:42:30.159 --> 01:42:32.229 align:start position:0% devices that are 01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0% 01:42:32.239 --> 01:42:34.470 align:start position:0% pretty smart at certain things or 01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0% 01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.629 align:start position:0% capable of certain things but 01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0% 01:42:36.639 --> 01:42:39.109 align:start position:0% potentially won't have any semblance of 01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0% 01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:40.950 align:start position:0% self-awareness or other things and in 01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0% 01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.550 align:start position:0% fact i would advocate 01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0% 01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.790 align:start position:0% if there's a choice building systems in 01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0% 01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.950 align:start position:0% the first place ai systems that are not 01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0% 01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.270 align:start position:0% conscious to begin with uh are just 01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0% 01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.310 align:start position:0% tools um until we understand them better 01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0% 01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.310 align:start position:0% and the capabilities better so on that 01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0% 01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.470 align:start position:0% topic just not 01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0% 01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.270 align:start position:0% as the ceo of deep mind 01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0% 01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.790 align:start position:0% just as a human being let me ask you 01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.870 align:start position:0% about this one particular anecdotal 01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0% 01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.189 align:start position:0% evidence of the google engineer 01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:43:05.199 --> 01:43:07.109 align:start position:0% who made a comment 01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0% 01:43:07.119 --> 01:43:07.990 align:start position:0% or 01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0% 01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.149 align:start position:0% believed that there's some aspect of a 01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0% 01:43:10.159 --> 01:43:11.669 align:start position:0% language model 01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0% 01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:14.390 align:start position:0% the lambda language model that exhibited 01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.830 align:start position:0% sentience 01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0% 01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.590 align:start position:0% so you said you believe there might be a 01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0% 01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.430 align:start position:0% responsibility to build systems that are 01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0% 01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.390 align:start position:0% not essential and this experience of a 01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0% 01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.709 align:start position:0% particular engineer i think i'd love to 01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0% 01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:26.149 align:start position:0% get your general opinion on this kind of 01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0% 01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:28.070 align:start position:0% thing but i think it will happen more 01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0% 01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.430 align:start position:0% and more and more 01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0% 01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.910 align:start position:0% which uh not when engineers but when 01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0% 01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.030 align:start position:0% people out there that don't have an 01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0% 01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.629 align:start position:0% engineering background start interacting 01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0% 01:43:34.639 --> 01:43:37.030 align:start position:0% with increasingly intelligent systems 01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0% 01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.910 align:start position:0% we anthropomorphize them they they start 01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0% 01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.030 align:start position:0% to have deep impactful 01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0% 01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.430 align:start position:0% um interactions with us in a way that we 01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0% 01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.910 align:start position:0% miss them yeah when they're gone 01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0% 01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.629 align:start position:0% 01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0% 01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:50.790 align:start position:0% we sure feel like they're 01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0% 01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.270 align:start position:0% living entities self-aware entities and 01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0% 01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.430 align:start position:0% maybe even we project sentience onto 01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0% 01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.430 align:start position:0% them so what what's your thought about 01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0% 01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.870 align:start position:0% this particular 01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0% 01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.189 align:start position:0% uh system was is uh 01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0% 01:44:01.199 --> 01:44:02.950 align:start position:0% have you ever met a language model 01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0% 01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.470 align:start position:0% that's sentient 01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0% 01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.510 align:start position:0% no i no no what do you make of the case 01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0% 01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.950 align:start position:0% of when you kind of 01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0% 01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.990 align:start position:0% feel 01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0% 01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.669 align:start position:0% that there's some elements of sentience 01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0% 01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:13.830 align:start position:0% to this system yeah so this is you know 01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0% 01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.750 align:start position:0% an interesting question and uh uh 01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0% 01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.830 align:start position:0% obviously a very fundamental one so 01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0% 01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.910 align:start position:0% first thing to say is i think that 01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0% 01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.590 align:start position:0% none of the systems we have today i i 01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0% 01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:24.310 align:start position:0% would say even have one iota of uh 01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.149 align:start position:0% semblance of consciousness or sentience 01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0% 01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:28.310 align:start position:0% that's my personal feeling interacting 01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0% 01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.229 align:start position:0% with them every day so i think that's 01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0% 01:44:30.239 --> 01:44:32.629 align:start position:0% way premature to be discussing what that 01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0% 01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:34.550 align:start position:0% engineer talked about i appreciate i 01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0% 01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.830 align:start position:0% think at the moment it's more of a 01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0% 01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.750 align:start position:0% projection of the way our own minds work 01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0% 01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.189 align:start position:0% which is to see 01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0% 01:44:39.199 --> 01:44:42.950 align:start position:0% uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction 01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0% 01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.629 align:start position:0% in almost anything that we you know our 01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0% 01:44:44.639 --> 01:44:47.350 align:start position:0% brains are trained to interpret uh 01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0% 01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.070 align:start position:0% agency basically in things uh even the 01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0% 01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.470 align:start position:0% an inanimate thing sometimes and of 01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0% 01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.870 align:start position:0% course with a a language system because 01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0% 01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0% language is so fundamental to 01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0% 01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.750 align:start position:0% intelligence that's going to be easy for 01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0% 01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.229 align:start position:0% us to anthropomorphize that 01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0% 01:45:00.239 --> 01:45:03.430 align:start position:0% i mean back in the day even the first uh 01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0% 01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.950 align:start position:0% you know the dumbest sort of template 01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0% 01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.590 align:start position:0% chatbots ever eliza and and and and the 01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0% 01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.510 align:start position:0% ilk of the original chatbots back in the 01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0% 01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.510 align:start position:0% 60s fooled some people under certain 01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0% 01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0% circumstances right they pretended to be 01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0% 01:45:13.199 --> 01:45:15.430 align:start position:0% a psychologist so just basically rabbit 01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0% 01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.030 align:start position:0% back to you the same question you asked 01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0% 01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.109 align:start position:0% it back to you um 01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0% 01:45:19.119 --> 01:45:21.350 align:start position:0% and uh some people believe that so i 01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0% 01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.109 align:start position:0% don't think we can this is why i think 01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0% 01:45:23.119 --> 01:45:24.470 align:start position:0% the turing test is a little bit flawed 01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0% 01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:26.229 align:start position:0% as a formal test because it depends on 01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0% 01:45:26.239 --> 01:45:28.629 align:start position:0% the sophistication of the of the judge 01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0% 01:45:28.639 --> 01:45:31.590 align:start position:0% um whether or not they are qualified to 01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0% 01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0% make that distinction so 01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0% 01:45:34.159 --> 01:45:36.629 align:start position:0% i think we should uh talk to you know 01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0% 01:45:36.639 --> 01:45:38.149 align:start position:0% the the top philosophers about this 01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0% 01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:40.229 align:start position:0% people like daniel dennett and uh david 01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0% 01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:41.750 align:start position:0% chalmers and others who've obviously 01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0% 01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.590 align:start position:0% thought deeply about consciousness of 01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0% 01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.270 align:start position:0% course consciousness itself hasn't been 01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0% 01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:47.830 align:start position:0% well there's no agreed definition if i 01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0% 01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.109 align:start position:0% was to you know uh speculate about that 01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0% 01:45:51.119 --> 01:45:53.189 align:start position:0% uh you know i kind of the definite the 01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:45:53.199 --> 01:45:55.189 align:start position:0% working definition i like is it's the 01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0% 01:45:55.199 --> 01:45:57.109 align:start position:0% way information feels when you know it 01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0% 01:45:57.119 --> 01:45:59.109 align:start position:0% gets processed i think maybe max tegmark 01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0% 01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.870 align:start position:0% came up with that i like that idea i 01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0% 01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.070 align:start position:0% don't know if it helps us get towards 01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0% 01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.470 align:start position:0% any more operational thing but but it's 01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0% 01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.149 align:start position:0% it's it's i think it's a nice way of 01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0% 01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:08.790 align:start position:0% viewing it um i think we can obviously 01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0% 01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.149 align:start position:0% see from neuroscience certain 01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0% 01:46:10.159 --> 01:46:11.750 align:start position:0% prerequisites that are required like 01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0% 01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.470 align:start position:0% self-awareness i think is necessary but 01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0% 01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:16.709 align:start position:0% not sufficient component this idea of a 01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0% 01:46:16.719 --> 01:46:19.430 align:start position:0% self and other and set of coherent 01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0% 01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.310 align:start position:0% preferences that are coherent over time 01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0% 01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.310 align:start position:0% you know these things are maybe memory 01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.550 align:start position:0% um these things are probably needed for 01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0% 01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.590 align:start position:0% a sentient or conscious being um but but 01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0% 01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.109 align:start position:0% the reason that the difficult thing i 01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0% 01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:32.390 align:start position:0% think for us when we get and i think 01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0% 01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.270 align:start position:0% this is a really interesting 01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0% 01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.669 align:start position:0% philosophical debate is when we get 01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0% 01:46:35.679 --> 01:46:38.870 align:start position:0% closer to agi and and and you know 01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0% 01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.629 align:start position:0% and and much more powerful systems than 01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0% 01:46:40.639 --> 01:46:41.830 align:start position:0% we have today 01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0% 01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.430 align:start position:0% um how are we going to make this 01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0% 01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.550 align:start position:0% judgment and one way which is the turing 01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0% 01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.030 align:start position:0% test is sort of a behavioral judgment is 01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0% 01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.629 align:start position:0% is the system exhibiting all the 01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0% 01:46:50.639 --> 01:46:54.070 align:start position:0% behaviors um that a human sentient uh or 01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0% 01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.590 align:start position:0% a sentient being would would would 01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0% 01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.590 align:start position:0% exhibit um is it answering the right 01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0% 01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.030 align:start position:0% questions is it saying the right things 01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0% 01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.830 align:start position:0% is it indistinguishable from a human um 01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0% 01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.270 align:start position:0% and so on 01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0% 01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.910 align:start position:0% but i think there's a second thing that 01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0% 01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.470 align:start position:0% makes us as humans regard each other as 01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0% 01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.629 align:start position:0% sentient right why do we why do we think 01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0% 01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:11.990 align:start position:0% this and i debated this with daniel 01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0% 01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.430 align:start position:0% dennett and i think there's a second 01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0% 01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.750 align:start position:0% reason that's often overlooked which is 01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0% 01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.910 align:start position:0% that we're running on the same substrate 01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0% 01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.750 align:start position:0% right so if we're exhibiting the same 01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0% 01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:22.790 align:start position:0% behavior uh more or less as humans and 01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0% 01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.310 align:start position:0% we're running on the same you know 01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0% 01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.149 align:start position:0% carbon-based biological substrate the 01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0% 01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:28.310 align:start position:0% squishy you know few pounds of of flesh 01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0% 01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.030 align:start position:0% in our skulls then the most parsimonious 01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0% 01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.350 align:start position:0% i think explanation is that you're 01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0% 01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.870 align:start position:0% feeling the same thing as i'm feeling 01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0% 01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.270 align:start position:0% right but we will never have that second 01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0% 01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.669 align:start position:0% part the substrate equivalence with a 01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0% 01:47:39.679 --> 01:47:40.629 align:start position:0% machine 01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0% 01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:42.629 align:start position:0% right so we will have to only judge 01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0% 01:47:42.639 --> 01:47:44.470 align:start position:0% based on the behavior and i think the 01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0% 01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.709 align:start position:0% substrate equivalence is a critical part 01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0% 01:47:46.719 --> 01:47:48.470 align:start position:0% of why we make assumptions that we're 01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0% 01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.229 align:start position:0% conscious and in fact even with with 01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0% 01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:51.990 align:start position:0% animals high-level animals why we think 01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0% 01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.270 align:start position:0% they might be because they're exhibiting 01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0% 01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.550 align:start position:0% some of the behaviors we would expect 01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0% 01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.310 align:start position:0% from a sentient animal and we know 01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0% 01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.430 align:start position:0% they're made of the same things 01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0% 01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.030 align:start position:0% biological neurons so we're gonna have 01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0% 01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.109 align:start position:0% to come up with 01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0% 01:48:01.119 --> 01:48:03.910 align:start position:0% explanations uh or models of the gap 01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0% 01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.550 align:start position:0% between substrate differences between 01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0% 01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.270 align:start position:0% machines and humans did to get anywhere 01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0% 01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.750 align:start position:0% beyond the behavioral but to me sort of 01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0% 01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.830 align:start position:0% the practical question is 01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0% 01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.070 align:start position:0% very interesting and very important when 01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0% 01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.229 align:start position:0% you have millions perhaps billions of 01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0% 01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:19.990 align:start position:0% people believing that you have ascension 01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0% 01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.310 align:start position:0% ai believing what that google engineer 01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0% 01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.910 align:start position:0% believed 01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0% 01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:26.390 align:start position:0% which i just see is an obvious 01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0% 01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.189 align:start position:0% very near-term future thing certainly on 01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0% 01:48:29.199 --> 01:48:31.109 align:start position:0% the path to agi 01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0% 01:48:31.119 --> 01:48:33.030 align:start position:0% how does that change the world 01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0% 01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.790 align:start position:0% what's the responsibility of the ai 01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0% 01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.070 align:start position:0% system to help those millions of people 01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0% 01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.669 align:start position:0% and also what's the ethical thing 01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0% 01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:40.870 align:start position:0% 01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0% 01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.510 align:start position:0% you can you can make a lot of people 01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0% 01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.950 align:start position:0% happy 01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0% 01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:48.229 align:start position:0% by creating a meaningful deep experience 01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0% 01:48:48.239 --> 01:48:49.910 align:start position:0% with a system 01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0% 01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:52.950 align:start position:0% that's faking it before it makes it yeah 01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0% 01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.390 align:start position:0% and i i don't 01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0% 01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.830 align:start position:0% is a are we the right or who is to say 01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0% 01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.709 align:start position:0% what's the right thing to do should ai 01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0% 01:49:00.719 --> 01:49:03.830 align:start position:0% always be tools like why why why are we 01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0% 01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.070 align:start position:0% constraining ais to always be tools as 01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0% 01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.189 align:start position:0% opposed to 01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0% 01:49:07.199 --> 01:49:09.590 align:start position:0% friends yeah i think well i mean these 01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0% 01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.430 align:start position:0% are you know you know fantastic 01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0% 01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.470 align:start position:0% questions and and also critical ones and 01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0% 01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.550 align:start position:0% we've been thinking about this uh since 01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0% 01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.390 align:start position:0% the start of d minor before that because 01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0% 01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.790 align:start position:0% we planned for success and you know how 01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0% 01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.629 align:start position:0% how you know you know however remote 01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0% 01:49:22.639 --> 01:49:25.030 align:start position:0% that looked like back in 2010 and we've 01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0% 01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.229 align:start position:0% always had sort of these ethical 01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0% 01:49:26.239 --> 01:49:27.910 align:start position:0% considerations as fundamental at 01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0% 01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.030 align:start position:0% deepmind um and my current thinking on 01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0% 01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.790 align:start position:0% the language models is and and large 01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0% 01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.390 align:start position:0% models is they're not ready we don't 01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0% 01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:37.109 align:start position:0% understand them well enough yet um and 01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0% 01:49:37.119 --> 01:49:39.350 align:start position:0% you know in terms of analysis tools and 01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0% 01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.270 align:start position:0% and guard rails what they can and can't 01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0% 01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:43.830 align:start position:0% do and so on to deploy them at scale 01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0% 01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.070 align:start position:0% because i think you know there are big 01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0% 01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.510 align:start position:0% still ethical questions like should an 01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0% 01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.589 align:start position:0% ai system always announce that it is an 01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0% 01:49:49.599 --> 01:49:52.709 align:start position:0% ai system to begin with probably yes um 01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0% 01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.390 align:start position:0% it what what do you do about answering 01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0% 01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.310 align:start position:0% those philosophical questions about the 01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0% 01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.470 align:start position:0% feelings uh people may have about ai 01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0% 01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.870 align:start position:0% systems perhaps incorrectly attributed 01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0% 01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.470 align:start position:0% so i think there's a whole bunch of 01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0% 01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.270 align:start position:0% research that needs to be done first um 01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0% 01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.109 align:start position:0% to responsibly before you know you can 01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0% 01:50:07.119 --> 01:50:08.950 align:start position:0% responsibly deploy these systems at 01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0% 01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.030 align:start position:0% scale that would be at least be my 01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0% 01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.390 align:start position:0% current position 01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0% 01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.390 align:start position:0% over time i'm very confident we'll have 01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.310 align:start position:0% those tools like interpretability 01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0% 01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.390 align:start position:0% questions um 01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0% 01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.589 align:start position:0% and uh analysis questions uh and then 01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0% 01:50:21.599 --> 01:50:23.510 align:start position:0% with the ethical quandary you know i 01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0% 01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.870 align:start position:0% think there 01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0% 01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.629 align:start position:0% it's important to 01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0% 01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:29.030 align:start position:0% uh look beyond just science that's why i 01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0% 01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.910 align:start position:0% think philosophy social sciences even 01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0% 01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.910 align:start position:0% theology other things like that come 01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0% 01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.310 align:start position:0% into it where um what you know arts and 01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0% 01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.629 align:start position:0% humanities what what does it mean to be 01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0% 01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:40.390 align:start position:0% human and the spirit of being human and 01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0% 01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.709 align:start position:0% and to enhance that and and the human 01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0% 01:50:42.719 --> 01:50:44.229 align:start position:0% condition right and allow us to 01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0% 01:50:44.239 --> 01:50:45.430 align:start position:0% experience things we could never 01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0% 01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.350 align:start position:0% experience before and improve the the 01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0% 01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.589 align:start position:0% overall human condition and humanity 01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0% 01:50:49.599 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0% overall you know get radical abundance 01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0% 01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.189 align:start position:0% solve many scientific problems solve 01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:55.270 align:start position:0% disease so this is the era i think this 01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0% 01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:57.109 align:start position:0% is the amazing era i think we're heading 01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0% 01:50:57.119 --> 01:50:59.750 align:start position:0% into if we do it right um but we've got 01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0% 01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.430 align:start position:0% to be careful we've already seen with 01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0% 01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.510 align:start position:0% things like social media how dual use 01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0% 01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.550 align:start position:0% technologies can be misused by firstly 01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0% 01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:09.910 align:start position:0% by by by bad you know p bad actors or 01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0% 01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.229 align:start position:0% naive actors or crazy actors right so 01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0% 01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:14.070 align:start position:0% there's that set of just the common or 01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0% 01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.870 align:start position:0% garden misuse of existing dual use 01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0% 01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:19.109 align:start position:0% technology and then of course there's an 01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0% 01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:21.109 align:start position:0% additional uh uh thing that has to be 01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0% 01:51:21.119 --> 01:51:23.030 align:start position:0% overcome with ai that eventually it may 01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0% 01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.990 align:start position:0% have its own agency so it could be uh uh 01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0% 01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.790 align:start position:0% uh good or bad in in in of itself so i 01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0% 01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.550 align:start position:0% think these questions have to be 01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0% 01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.669 align:start position:0% approached very carefully um using the 01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0% 01:51:33.679 --> 01:51:35.589 align:start position:0% scientific method i would say in terms 01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0% 01:51:35.599 --> 01:51:37.830 align:start position:0% of hypothesis generation careful control 01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0% 01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.229 align:start position:0% testing not live a b testing out in the 01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0% 01:51:40.239 --> 01:51:42.310 align:start position:0% world because with powerful dual 01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0% 01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.229 align:start position:0% technologies like ai 01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0% 01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:46.390 align:start position:0% if something goes wrong it may cause you 01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0% 01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.709 align:start position:0% know a lot of harm before you can fix it 01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0% 01:51:48.719 --> 01:51:50.470 align:start position:0% um it's not like a you know an imaging 01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0% 01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.189 align:start position:0% app or game app where you know that if 01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:51:53.199 --> 01:51:55.189 align:start position:0% if something goes wrong it's relatively 01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0% 01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.709 align:start position:0% easy to fix and and the harm's 01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0% 01:51:56.719 --> 01:51:58.790 align:start position:0% relatively small so i think 01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0% 01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.350 align:start position:0% it comes with you know the the the usual 01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0% 01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.910 align:start position:0% uh cliche of like with a lot of power 01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0% 01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:05.270 align:start position:0% comes a lot of responsibility and i 01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0% 01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:07.030 align:start position:0% think that's the case here with things 01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0% 01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.030 align:start position:0% like ai given the the enormous 01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0% 01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.830 align:start position:0% opportunity in front of us and i think 01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0% 01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.629 align:start position:0% we need a lot of voices uh and as many 01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0% 01:52:14.639 --> 01:52:17.109 align:start position:0% inputs into things like the design of 01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0% 01:52:17.119 --> 01:52:19.109 align:start position:0% the systems and the values 01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0% 01:52:19.119 --> 01:52:20.550 align:start position:0% they should have and what goals should 01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0% 01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:23.109 align:start position:0% they be put to um i think as wide a 01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0% 01:52:23.119 --> 01:52:24.950 align:start position:0% group of voices as possible beyond just 01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0% 01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.109 align:start position:0% the technologies is needed uh to input 01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0% 01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:28.950 align:start position:0% into that and to have a say in that 01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0% 01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.550 align:start position:0% especially when it comes to deployment 01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0% 01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.229 align:start position:0% of these systems which is when the 01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0% 01:52:32.239 --> 01:52:33.589 align:start position:0% rubber really hits the road it really 01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0% 01:52:33.599 --> 01:52:35.270 align:start position:0% affects the general person in the street 01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0% 01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:37.350 align:start position:0% rather than fundamental research and 01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0% 01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.030 align:start position:0% that's why i say 01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0% 01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.550 align:start position:0% i think as a first step it would be 01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0% 01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.870 align:start position:0% better if we have the choice to build 01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0% 01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.510 align:start position:0% these systems as tools to give and i'm 01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0% 01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.709 align:start position:0% not saying that it should never they 01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0% 01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:47.990 align:start position:0% should never go beyond tools because of 01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0% 01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.390 align:start position:0% course the potential is there um for it 01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0% 01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.830 align:start position:0% to go way beyond just tools uh but um i 01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0% 01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.830 align:start position:0% think that would be a good first step 01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0% 01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.830 align:start position:0% in order for us to you know allow us to 01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0% 01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.510 align:start position:0% carefully experiment understand what 01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0% 01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.070 align:start position:0% these things can do so the leap between 01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0% 01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.070 align:start position:0% tool to sentient entity being is one 01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0% 01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.070 align:start position:0% should take very careful yes 01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0% 01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.950 align:start position:0% let me ask a dark personal question 01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0% 01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.030 align:start position:0% so you're one of the most brilliant 01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0% 01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.629 align:start position:0% people in the ag community also one of 01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0% 01:53:14.639 --> 01:53:15.589 align:start position:0% the most 01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0% 01:53:15.599 --> 01:53:16.709 align:start position:0% kind 01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0% 01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:19.510 align:start position:0% and uh if i may say sort of loved people 01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0% 01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0% in the community that said 01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0% 01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:24.149 align:start position:0% 01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0% 01:53:24.159 --> 01:53:26.149 align:start position:0% creation of a super intelligent ai 01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0% 01:53:26.159 --> 01:53:27.669 align:start position:0% 01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0% 01:53:27.679 --> 01:53:29.589 align:start position:0% would be one of the most 01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0% 01:53:29.599 --> 01:53:30.950 align:start position:0% powerful 01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0% 01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.709 align:start position:0% things in the world tools or otherwise 01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0% 01:53:34.719 --> 01:53:37.750 align:start position:0% and again as the old saying goes power 01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0% 01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.589 align:start position:0% corrupts and absolute power crops 01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0% 01:53:39.599 --> 01:53:41.589 align:start position:0% absolutely 01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0% 01:53:41.599 --> 01:53:43.350 align:start position:0% you are 01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0% 01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.109 align:start position:0% likely 01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0% 01:53:45.119 --> 01:53:47.430 align:start position:0% to be one of the people 01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0% 01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:49.750 align:start position:0% i would say probably the most likely 01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0% 01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.830 align:start position:0% person to be in the control of such a 01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0% 01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:53.189 align:start position:0% 01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:55.030 align:start position:0% do you think about 01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0% 01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.270 align:start position:0% the corrupting nature of power when you 01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0% 01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.310 align:start position:0% talk about these kinds of systems that 01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0% 01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.950 align:start position:0% um as all dictators 01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0% 01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.030 align:start position:0% and people have caused atrocities in the 01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0% 01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.990 align:start position:0% past always think they're doing good 01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0% 01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.910 align:start position:0% but they don't do good because the 01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0% 01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:12.149 align:start position:0% powers polluted their mind about what is 01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0% 01:54:12.159 --> 01:54:14.229 align:start position:0% good and what is evil do you think about 01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0% 01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:15.589 align:start position:0% this stuff or are we just focused on 01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0% 01:54:15.599 --> 01:54:17.669 align:start position:0% language modeling no i think about them 01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0% 01:54:17.679 --> 01:54:20.470 align:start position:0% all the time and you know i think 01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0% 01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.470 align:start position:0% what are the defenses against that i 01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0% 01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.229 align:start position:0% think one thing is to remain very 01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0% 01:54:24.239 --> 01:54:26.550 align:start position:0% grounded and sort of humble uh no matter 01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0% 01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.430 align:start position:0% what you do or achieve and i try to do 01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0% 01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:31.030 align:start position:0% that i might you know my best friends 01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0% 01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.629 align:start position:0% are still my set of friends from my 01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0% 01:54:32.639 --> 01:54:35.350 align:start position:0% undergraduate cambridge days my family's 01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0% 01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.109 align:start position:0% you know and and friends are very 01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0% 01:54:37.119 --> 01:54:38.229 align:start position:0% 01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0% 01:54:38.239 --> 01:54:39.109 align:start position:0% 01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0% 01:54:39.119 --> 01:54:40.629 align:start position:0% i've always i think trying to be a 01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0% 01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:42.950 align:start position:0% multi-disciplinary person it helps to 01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0% 01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.390 align:start position:0% keep you humble because no matter how 01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0% 01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.149 align:start position:0% good you are at one topic someone will 01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0% 01:54:46.159 --> 01:54:47.990 align:start position:0% be better than you at that and it and 01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0% 01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.990 align:start position:0% always relearning a new topic again from 01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0% 01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.950 align:start position:0% scratch is or new field is very humbling 01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0% 01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.950 align:start position:0% right so for me that's been biology over 01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0% 01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.270 align:start position:0% the last five years you know huge area 01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0% 01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:59.430 align:start position:0% topic and and and it's been and i just 01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0% 01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.030 align:start position:0% love doing that but it helps to keep you 01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0% 01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.229 align:start position:0% grounded like it keeps you open-minded 01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0% 01:55:04.239 --> 01:55:05.030 align:start position:0% 01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0% 01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.470 align:start position:0% and then the other important thing is to 01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0% 01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.109 align:start position:0% have a really good amazing set of uh 01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0% 01:55:09.119 --> 01:55:10.790 align:start position:0% people around you at your company or 01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0% 01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.950 align:start position:0% your organization who are also very 01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0% 01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:15.189 align:start position:0% ethical and grounded themselves and help 01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0% 01:55:15.199 --> 01:55:16.950 align:start position:0% to keep you that way 01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0% 01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.390 align:start position:0% and then ultimately just to answer your 01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0% 01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.990 align:start position:0% question i hope we're going to be a big 01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0% 01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.709 align:start position:0% part of of birthing ai and that being 01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0% 01:55:22.719 --> 01:55:24.629 align:start position:0% the greatest benefit to humanity of any 01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0% 01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:27.430 align:start position:0% tool or technology ever and and getting 01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0% 01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:29.910 align:start position:0% us into a world of radical abundance and 01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0% 01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:31.669 align:start position:0% curing diseases and 01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0% 01:55:31.679 --> 01:55:33.350 align:start position:0% and and solving many of the big 01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0% 01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.790 align:start position:0% challenges we have in front of us and 01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0% 01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.629 align:start position:0% then ultimately you know help the 01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0% 01:55:36.639 --> 01:55:38.310 align:start position:0% ultimate flourishing of humanity to 01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0% 01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.310 align:start position:0% travel the stars and find those aliens 01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0% 01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.589 align:start position:0% if they are there and if they're not 01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0% 01:55:41.599 --> 01:55:43.350 align:start position:0% there find out why they're not there 01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0% 01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.830 align:start position:0% what what is going on here in the 01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0% 01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.669 align:start position:0% universe um this is all to come and and 01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0% 01:55:47.679 --> 01:55:50.550 align:start position:0% that's what i've always dreamed about um 01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0% 01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.310 align:start position:0% but i don't think i think ai is too big 01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0% 01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.790 align:start position:0% an idea it's not going to be uh there'll 01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0% 01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.310 align:start position:0% be a certain set of pioneers who get 01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0% 01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.669 align:start position:0% there first i hope 01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0% 01:55:57.679 --> 01:55:58.870 align:start position:0% we're in the vanguard so we can 01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0% 01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.790 align:start position:0% influence how that goes and i think it 01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0% 01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.430 align:start position:0% matters who builds who which which 01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0% 01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:05.189 align:start position:0% cultures they come from and what values 01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0% 01:56:05.199 --> 01:56:07.669 align:start position:0% they have uh the builders of ai systems 01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0% 01:56:07.679 --> 01:56:08.870 align:start position:0% because i think even though the ai 01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0% 01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.390 align:start position:0% system is going to learn for itself most 01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0% 01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.790 align:start position:0% of its knowledge there'll be a residue 01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0% 01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.790 align:start position:0% in the system of the culture and the 01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0% 01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.510 align:start position:0% values of the creators of the system um 01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0% 01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.109 align:start position:0% and there's interesting questions to to 01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0% 01:56:19.119 --> 01:56:21.270 align:start position:0% discuss about that geopolitically you 01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0% 01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.709 align:start position:0% know different cultures as we're in a 01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0% 01:56:22.719 --> 01:56:24.070 align:start position:0% more fragmented world than ever 01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0% 01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.910 align:start position:0% unfortunately i think in terms of global 01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0% 01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.350 align:start position:0% cooperation 01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0% 01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.270 align:start position:0% we see that in things like climate where 01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0% 01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.350 align:start position:0% we can't seem to get our act together uh 01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0% 01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.270 align:start position:0% globally to cooperate on these pressing 01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0% 01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.189 align:start position:0% matters i hope that will change over 01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0% 01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:37.189 align:start position:0% time perhaps you know if we get to an 01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0% 01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:38.950 align:start position:0% era of radical abundance we don't have 01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0% 01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.629 align:start position:0% to be so competitive anymore maybe we 01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0% 01:56:40.639 --> 01:56:42.550 align:start position:0% can be more cooperative 01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0% 01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.629 align:start position:0% if resources aren't so scarce it's true 01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0% 01:56:44.639 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0% 01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0% 01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.790 align:start position:0% in terms of 01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0% 01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.870 align:start position:0% power corrupting and leading to 01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0% 01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:51.350 align:start position:0% destructive things it seems that some of 01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0% 01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.189 align:start position:0% the atrocities of the past happen when 01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0% 01:56:53.199 --> 01:56:55.109 align:start position:0% there's a significant 01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0% 01:56:55.119 --> 01:56:56.950 align:start position:0% constraint on resources i think that's 01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0% 01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:57.910 align:start position:0% the first thing i don't think that's 01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0% 01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.589 align:start position:0% enough i think scarcity is one thing 01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0% 01:56:59.599 --> 01:57:01.910 align:start position:0% that's led to competition destruct you 01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0% 01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.910 align:start position:0% know sort of zero sum game thinking i 01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0% 01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.430 align:start position:0% would like us to all be in a positive 01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0% 01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.030 align:start position:0% sum world and i think for that you have 01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0% 01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.870 align:start position:0% to remove scarcity i don't think that's 01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0% 01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:10.709 align:start position:0% enough unfortunately to get world peace 01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0% 01:57:10.719 --> 01:57:12.390 align:start position:0% because there's also other corrupting 01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0% 01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.470 align:start position:0% things like wanting power over people 01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0% 01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.910 align:start position:0% and this kind of stuff which is not 01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0% 01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:17.990 align:start position:0% necessarily satisfied by by just 01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0% 01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.030 align:start position:0% abundance but i think it will help um 01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0% 01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.589 align:start position:0% and i think uh but i think ultimately ai 01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0% 01:57:23.599 --> 01:57:25.669 align:start position:0% is not going to be run by any one person 01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0% 01:57:25.679 --> 01:57:27.030 align:start position:0% or one organization i think it should 01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0% 01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.430 align:start position:0% belong to the world belong to humanity 01:57:29.430 -->

01:57:33.109 align:start position:0% many ways this will happen and 01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0% 01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:35.189 align:start position:0% ultimately um

giving talks to the next 01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0% 01:57:56.239 --> 01:57:58.149 align:start position:0% generation what i say to them is 01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0% 01:57:58.159 --> 01:58:00.149 align:start position:0% actually two things i i think the most 01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0% 01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:02.470 align:start position:0% important things to learn about and to 01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0% 01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.830 align:start position:0% find out about when you're when you're 01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0% 01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.229 align:start position:0% young is what are your true passions is 01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0% 01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:08.149 align:start position:0% first of all there's two things one is 01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0% 01:58:08.159 --> 01:58:10.550 align:start position:0% find your true passions and i think you 01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0% 01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.629 align:start position:0% can do that by the way to do that is to 01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0% 01:58:12.639 --> 01:58:14.629 align:start position:0% explore as many things as possible when 01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0% 01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:16.390 align:start position:0% you're young and you you have the time 01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0% 01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.950 align:start position:0% and you and you can take those risks um 01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0% 01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.709 align:start position:0% i would also encourage people to look at 01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0% 01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:22.470 align:start position:0% the finding the connections between 01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0% 01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.430 align:start position:0% things 01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0% 01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.430 align:start position:0% in a unique way i think that's a really 01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0% 01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.669 align:start position:0% great way to find a passion second thing 01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0% 01:58:27.679 --> 01:58:31.030 align:start position:0% i would say advise is know yourself so 01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0% 01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.109 align:start position:0% spend a lot of time 01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0% 01:58:33.119 --> 01:58:35.910 align:start position:0% understanding how you work best like 01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0% 01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.669 align:start position:0% what are the optimal times to work what 01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0% 01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:39.750 align:start position:0% are the optimal ways that you study um 01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0% 01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.030 align:start position:0% what are your how do you deal with 01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0% 01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.149 align:start position:0% pressure 01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0% 01:58:42.159 --> 01:58:43.750 align:start position:0% sort of test yourself in various 01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0% 01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.910 align:start position:0% scenarios and try and improve your 01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0% 01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.709 align:start position:0% weaknesses but also find out what your 01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0% 01:58:48.719 --> 01:58:51.030 align:start position:0% unique skills and strengths are and then 01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0% 01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.510 align:start position:0% hone those so then that's what will be 01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0% 01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:55.750 align:start position:0% your super value in the world later on 01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0% 01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.350 align:start position:0% and if you can then combine those two 01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0% 01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.189 align:start position:0% things and find passions that you're 01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0% 01:58:59.199 --> 01:59:02.310 align:start position:0% genuinely excited about that intersect 01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0% 01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:05.270 align:start position:0% with what your unique strong skills are 01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0% 01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:06.790 align:start position:0% then you're you know you're on to 01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0% 01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:08.550 align:start position:0% something incredible and and you know i 01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0% 01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.149 align:start position:0% think you can make a huge difference in 01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0% 01:59:10.159 --> 01:59:12.070 align:start position:0% the world so let me ask about know 01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0% 01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.390 align:start position:0% yourself this is fun this is fun quick 01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0% 01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.109 align:start position:0% questions about day in the life the 01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0% 01:59:17.119 --> 01:59:19.189

yeah maybe 01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0% 01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.870 align:start position:0% uh maybe these days you're um 01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0% 01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.870 align:start position:0% there's a lot involved yeah it may be a 01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0% 01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.950 align:start position:0% slightly younger 01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0% 01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.149 align:start position:0% you could focus on a demonstration 01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0% 01:59:30.159 --> 01:59:33.109 align:start position:0% project maybe um 01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0% 01:59:33.119 --> 01:59:34.870

the morning 01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0% 01:59:36.639 --> 01:59:38.709 align:start position:0% what are some interesting habits 01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0% 01:59:38.719 --> 01:59:41.030 align:start position:0% uh how many dozens of cups of coffees do 01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0% 01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:44.470 align:start position:0% you drink a day what's the computer um 01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0% 01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.910 align:start position:0% that you use 01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0% 01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.750 align:start position:0% uh what's the setup how many screens 01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0% 01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:50.310 align:start position:0% what kind of keyboard are we talking uh 01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0% 01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.470 align:start position:0% emacs vim are we talking something more 01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0% 01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.990 align:start position:0% modern so it's a bunch of those 01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0% 01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.870 align:start position:0% questions so maybe uh day in the life 01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0% 01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.790

different 02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0% 02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:03.270 align:start position:0% from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20 02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0% 02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.430 align:start position:0% years ago it would have been you know a 02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0% 02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.149 align:start position:0% whole day of 02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0% 02:00:08.159 --> 02:00:10.070 align:start position:0% research individual research or 02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0% 02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.830 align:start position:0% programming doing some experiment 02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0% 02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.910 align:start position:0% neuroscience computer science experiment 02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0% 02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.550 align:start position:0% reading lots of research papers uh and 02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0% 02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.589 align:start position:0% then perhaps at night time you know um 02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0% 02:00:19.599 --> 02:00:23.189 align:start position:0% reading science fiction books or or uh 02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0% 02:00:23.199 --> 02:00:26.310 align:start position:0% playing uh some games but lots of focus 02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0% 02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.629 align:start position:0% so like deep focused work on whether 02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0% 02:00:28.639 --> 02:00:29.830 align:start position:0% it's uh 02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0% 02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.669 align:start position:0% programming or reading research paper 02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0% 02:00:31.679 --> 02:00:33.270 align:start position:0% yes yes so that would be a lot of 02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0% 02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.430 align:start position:0% debrief you know uh focused work these 02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0% 02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.750 align:start position:0% days for the last sort of i guess you 02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0% 02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.070 align:start position:0% know five to ten years i've actually got 02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0% 02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.589 align:start position:0% quite a structure that works very well 02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0% 02:00:41.599 --> 02:00:44.149 align:start position:0% for me now which is that um i'm a night 02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0% 02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:46.310 align:start position:0% complete night out always have been so i 02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0% 02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.870 align:start position:0% optimized for that so you know i get you 02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0% 02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.550 align:start position:0% know i basically do a normal day's work 02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0% 02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:52.950 align:start position:0% get into work about 11 o'clock and sort 02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0% 02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.109 align:start position:0% of do work to about seven uh in the 02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0% 02:00:55.119 --> 02:00:57.669 align:start position:0% office uh and i will arrange 02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0% 02:00:57.679 --> 02:00:59.589 align:start position:0% back-to-back meetings for the entire 02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0% 02:00:59.599 --> 02:01:02.310 align:start position:0% time of that and with as many me as many 02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0% 02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.510 align:start position:0% people as possible so that's my 02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0% 02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:06.390 align:start position:0% collaboration management part of the day 02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0% 02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.550 align:start position:0% then i go home uh spend time with the 02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0% 02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:12.310 align:start position:0% family and friends uh have dinner uh uh 02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0% 02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.149 align:start position:0% relax a little bit and then i start a 02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0% 02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:15.750 align:start position:0% second day of work i call it my second 02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0% 02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.030 align:start position:0% day work around 10 pm 11 p.m and that's 02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0% 02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:20.709 align:start position:0% the time till about the small hours of 02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0% 02:01:20.719 --> 02:01:22.390 align:start position:0% the morning four five in the morning 02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0% 02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:25.750 align:start position:0% where i will do my thinking and reading 02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0% 02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.870 align:start position:0% a research writing research papers um 02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0% 02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.790 align:start position:0% sadly don't have time to code anymore 02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0% 02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.709 align:start position:0% but it's it's not efficient to to do 02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0% 02:01:32.719 --> 02:01:35.189 align:start position:0% that uh these days uh given the amount 02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0% 02:01:35.199 --> 02:01:37.910 align:start position:0% of time i have um but that's when i do 02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0% 02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:39.990 align:start position:0% you know maybe do the long kind of 02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0% 02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.310 align:start position:0% stretches of of thinking and planning 02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0% 02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.070 align:start position:0% and then probably you know using using 02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0% 02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.830 align:start position:0% email or other things i would set i 02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0% 02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:47.270 align:start position:0% would fire off a lot of things to my 02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0% 02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.430 align:start position:0% team to deal with the next morning for 02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0% 02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.510 align:start position:0% actually thinking about this overnight 02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0% 02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.430 align:start position:0% we should go for this project or arrange 02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0% 02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:54.950 align:start position:0% this meeting the next day when you're 02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0% 02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.070 align:start position:0% thinking through a problem are you 02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0% 02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:57.430 align:start position:0% talking about a sheet of paper or the 02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0% 02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.189 align:start position:0% patent pen is there some independent 02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0% 02:01:59.199 --> 02:02:01.430 align:start position:0% structure yeah i like processes i still 02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.669 align:start position:0% like pencil and paper best for working 02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0% 02:02:03.679 --> 02:02:05.990 align:start position:0% out things but um these days it's just 02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0% 02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.669 align:start position:0% so efficient to read research papers 02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0% 02:02:07.679 --> 02:02:09.430 align:start position:0% just on the screen i still often print 02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:11.430 align:start position:0% them out actually i still prefer to 02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.430 align:start position:0% mark out things and i find it goes into 02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:15.270 align:start position:0% the brain quick better and sticks in the 02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0% 02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:17.350 align:start position:0% brain better when you're you're still 02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0% 02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.350 align:start position:0% using physical pen and pencil and paper 02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0% 02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:21.109 align:start position:0% so you take notes with the i have lots 02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0% 02:02:21.119 --> 02:02:23.430 align:start position:0% of nodes electronic ones and also um 02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.430 align:start position:0% whole stacks of notebooks that 02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.830 align:start position:0% um that i use at home yeah on some of 02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0% 02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.830 align:start position:0% these most challenging next steps for 02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0% 02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.430 align:start position:0% example stuff 02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0% 02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.790 align:start position:0% none of us know about that you're 02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0% 02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:35.350 align:start position:0% working on you're thinking 02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0% 02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.950 align:start position:0% there's some deep thinking required 02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0% 02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.709 align:start position:0% there right like what what is the right 02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0% 02:02:38.719 --> 02:02:41.270 align:start position:0% problem what is the right approach 02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0% 02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.790 align:start position:0% because you're gonna have to invest a 02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0% 02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.629 align:start position:0% huge amount of time for the whole team 02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0% 02:02:44.639 --> 02:02:45.990 align:start position:0% they're going to have to pursue this 02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0% 02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.390 align:start position:0% thing what's the right way to do it is 02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0% 02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.750 align:start position:0% is rl going to work here or not yes um 02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0% 02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:53.350 align:start position:0% what's the right thing to try what's the 02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0% 02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.270 align:start position:0% right benchmark to use yeah we need to 02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0% 02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.270 align:start position:0% construct a benchmark from scratch all 02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0% 02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.189 align:start position:0% those kinds of things yes so i think all 02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0% 02:02:59.199 --> 02:03:00.790 align:start position:0% those kind of things in the night time 02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0% 02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.229 align:start position:0% phase but also much more um i find i've 02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0% 02:03:04.239 --> 02:03:06.149 align:start position:0% always found the quiet hours of the 02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0% 02:03:06.159 --> 02:03:09.189 align:start position:0% morning um when everyone's asleep it's 02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0% 02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:12.070 align:start position:0% super quiet outside um i love that time 02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0% 02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.229 align:start position:0% it's the golden hours like between like 02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0% 02:03:14.239 --> 02:03:16.629 align:start position:0% one and three in the morning um put some 02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0% 02:03:16.639 --> 02:03:18.950 align:start position:0% music on some inspiring music on and 02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0% 02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:21.510 align:start position:0% then um think these deep thoughts so 02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0% 02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:23.109 align:start position:0% that's when i would read you know my 02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0% 02:03:23.119 --> 02:03:26.310 align:start position:0% philosophy books and uh spinoza's my you 02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0% 02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.070 align:start position:0% know recent favorite can all these 02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0% 02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.109 align:start position:0% things i i i you know read about a great 02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0% 02:03:31.119 --> 02:03:32.229 align:start position:0% uh uh 02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0% 02:03:32.239 --> 02:03:33.990 align:start position:0% a scientist of history how they did 02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0% 02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.070 align:start position:0% things how they thought things so that's 02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0% 02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.430 align:start position:0% when you do all your create that's when 02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0% 02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:39.270 align:start position:0% i do all my creative thinking and it's 02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0% 02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.669 align:start position:0% good i think i think people recommend 02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0% 02:03:41.679 --> 02:03:43.510 align:start position:0% you know you do your your your sort of 02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0% 02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:45.589 align:start position:0% creative thinking in one block and the 02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0% 02:03:45.599 --> 02:03:47.589 align:start position:0% way i organize the day that way i don't 02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0% 02:03:47.599 --> 02:03:49.109 align:start position:0% get interrupted because obviously no one 02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0% 02:03:49.119 --> 02:03:52.390 align:start position:0% else is up uh at those times so i can i 02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0% 02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.109 align:start position:0% can go uh you know as i can sort of get 02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0% 02:03:55.119 --> 02:03:57.669 align:start position:0% super deep and super into flow the other 02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0% 02:03:57.679 --> 02:03:59.189 align:start position:0% nice thing about doing it night time 02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0% 02:03:59.199 --> 02:04:02.629 align:start position:0% wise is if i'm really uh onto something 02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0% 02:04:02.639 --> 02:04:04.229 align:start position:0% or i've i've got really deep into 02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0% 02:04:04.239 --> 02:04:06.870 align:start position:0% something i can choose to extend it and 02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0% 02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.790 align:start position:0% i'll go into six in the morning whatever 02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0% 02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.149 align:start position:0% and then i'll just pay for it the next 02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0% 02:04:10.159 --> 02:04:11.750 align:start position:0% day yeah cause i'll be a bit tired and i 02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0% 02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.069 align:start position:0% won't be my best but that's fine i can 02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0% 02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.990 align:start position:0% decide looking at my schedule the next 02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0% 02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.149 align:start position:0% day that and given where i'm at with 02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0% 02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:20.629 align:start position:0% this particular thought or creative idea 02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0% 02:04:20.639 --> 02:04:22.149 align:start position:0% that i'm going to pay that cost the next 02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0% 02:04:22.159 --> 02:04:24.629 align:start position:0% day so so i think that's that's more 02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0% 02:04:24.639 --> 02:04:27.189 align:start position:0% flexible than morning people who do that 02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0% 02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:28.310 align:start position:0% you know they get up at four in the 02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0% 02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:30.310 align:start position:0% morning they can also do those golden 02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0% 02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:31.990 align:start position:0% hours then but then their start of their 02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0% 02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.669 align:start position:0% schedule day starts at breakfast you 02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0% 02:04:33.679 --> 02:04:35.030 align:start position:0% know 8 a.m whatever they have their 02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0% 02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.709 align:start position:0% first meeting and then it's hard you 02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0% 02:04:36.719 --> 02:04:38.229 align:start position:0% have to reschedule a day if you're in 02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0% 02:04:38.239 --> 02:04:39.589 align:start position:0% flow yeah that's going to be i don't 02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0% 02:04:39.599 --> 02:04:41.270 align:start position:0% have to see that special threat of 02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0% 02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.790 align:start position:0% thoughts that 02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0% 02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.589 align:start position:0% the 02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0% 02:04:43.599 --> 02:04:44.950 align:start position:0% you're too passionate about you that 02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0% 02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.629 align:start position:0% this is where some of the greatest ideas 02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0% 02:04:46.639 --> 02:04:48.470 align:start position:0% could potentially come is when you just 02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0% 02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:51.270 align:start position:0% lose yourself late into yeah 02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0% 02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:53.270 align:start position:0% and for the meetings i mean you're 02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0% 02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.870 align:start position:0% loading in really hard problems in a 02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0% 02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.790 align:start position:0% very short amount of time so you have to 02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0% 02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.310 align:start position:0% do some kind of first principles 02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0% 02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.589 align:start position:0% thinking here it's like what's the 02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0% 02:04:59.599 --> 02:05:01.189 align:start position:0% problem what's the state of things 02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0% 02:05:01.199 --> 02:05:03.270 align:start position:0% what's the right next step yes you have 02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0% 02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.030 align:start position:0% to get really good at context switching 02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0% 02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.950 align:start position:0% which is one of the hardest things 02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0% 02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.550 align:start position:0% because especially as we do so many 02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0% 02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.149 align:start position:0% things if you include all the scientific 02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0% 02:05:10.159 --> 02:05:11.589 align:start position:0% things we do scientific fields we're 02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0% 02:05:11.599 --> 02:05:13.750 align:start position:0% working in these are entire you know 02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0% 02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.990 align:start position:0% complex fields in themselves and you you 02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0% 02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.229 align:start position:0% have to sort of keep up to abreast of 02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0% 02:05:18.239 --> 02:05:21.750 align:start position:0% that but i enjoy it i've always been uh 02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0% 02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:23.990 align:start position:0% a sort of generalist in a way and that's 02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0% 02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.109 align:start position:0% actually what happened with my games 02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0% 02:05:25.119 --> 02:05:28.069 align:start position:0% career after chess i i i one of the 02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0% 02:05:28.079 --> 02:05:29.350 align:start position:0% reasons i stopped playing chess was that 02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0% 02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.030 align:start position:0% i got into computers but also i started 02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0% 02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:32.470 align:start position:0% realizing there were many other great 02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0% 02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:34.470 align:start position:0% games out there to play too so 02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0% 02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.830 align:start position:0% i've always been that way inclined 02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0% 02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.510 align:start position:0% multidisciplinary and there's too many 02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0% 02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:39.109 align:start position:0% interesting things in in the world to 02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0% 02:05:39.119 --> 02:05:41.589 align:start position:0% spend all your time just on one thing 02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0% 02:05:41.599 --> 02:05:43.750 align:start position:0% so you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the 02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0% 02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:44.790 align:start position:0% big 02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0% 02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:47.510 align:start position:0% ridiculously big question about life 02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0% 02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.950 align:start position:0% what do you think is the meaning of this 02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0% 02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:50.069 align:start position:0% whole thing 02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0% 02:05:50.079 --> 02:05:53.030 align:start position:0% uh why are we humans here you've already 02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0% 02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.030 align:start position:0% mentioned that perhaps the universe 02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0% 02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.550 align:start position:0% created us 02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0% 02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:58.550 align:start position:0% is that why you think we're here 02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0% 02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.390 align:start position:0% to understand how the universe yeah i 02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0% 02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.149 align:start position:0% think my answer to that would be and at 02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0% 02:06:02.159 --> 02:06:04.470 align:start position:0% least the the life i'm living is to gain 02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0% 02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.189 align:start position:0% and uh to gain and understand the 02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0% 02:06:07.199 --> 02:06:09.189 align:start position:0% knowledge you know to gain knowledge and 02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0% 02:06:09.199 --> 02:06:11.030 align:start position:0% understand the universe that's what i 02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0% 02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:13.350 align:start position:0% think uh i can't see any higher purpose 02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0% 02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.550 align:start position:0% than that if you think back to the 02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0% 02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:16.229 align:start position:0% classical greeks you know the virtue of 02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0% 02:06:16.239 --> 02:06:18.390 align:start position:0% gaining knowledge it's uh i think it's 02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0% 02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:20.470 align:start position:0% that it's one of the few true virtues is 02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0% 02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:23.510 align:start position:0% to understand um the world around us and 02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0% 02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.629 align:start position:0% the context and humanity better and um 02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0% 02:06:26.639 --> 02:06:28.149 align:start position:0% and i think if you do that you become 02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0% 02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:29.830 align:start position:0% more compassionate and more 02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0% 02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.510 align:start position:0% understanding yourself and and more 02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0% 02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.030 align:start position:0% tolerant and all these i think all these 02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0% 02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:34.870 align:start position:0% other things may flow from that and to 02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0% 02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.669 align:start position:0% me 02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0% 02:06:35.679 --> 02:06:37.030 align:start position:0% you know understanding the nature of 02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0% 02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:38.629 align:start position:0% reality that is the biggest question 02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0% 02:06:38.639 --> 02:06:40.229 align:start position:0% what is going on here is sometimes the 02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0% 02:06:40.239 --> 02:06:41.910 align:start position:0% colloquial way i say what is really 02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0% 02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.189 align:start position:0% 02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0% 02:06:43.199 --> 02:06:45.430 align:start position:0% uh it's so mysterious i feel like we're 02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0% 02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.390 align:start position:0% in some huge puzzle and and it's but the 02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0% 02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.790 align:start position:0% world is also seems to be the universe 02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0% 02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:52.950 align:start position:0% seems to be structured in a way you know 02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0% 02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.310 align:start position:0% why is it structured in a way that 02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0% 02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:56.229 align:start position:0% science is even possible that you know 02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0% 02:06:56.239 --> 02:06:57.990 align:start position:0% methods the scientific method works 02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0% 02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.430 align:start position:0% things are repeatable 02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0% 02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:01.910 align:start position:0% um it feels like it's almost structured 02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0% 02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:04.069 align:start position:0% in a way to be conducive to gaining 02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0% 02:07:04.079 --> 02:07:06.390 align:start position:0% knowledge so i feel like and you know 02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0% 02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.830 align:start position:0% why should computers be even possible 02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0% 02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:10.629 align:start position:0% isn't that amazing that uh computational 02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0% 02:07:10.639 --> 02:07:13.109 align:start position:0% electronic devices can can can can be 02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0% 02:07:13.119 --> 02:07:15.189 align:start position:0% possible and they're made of sand our 02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0% 02:07:15.199 --> 02:07:16.870 align:start position:0% most you know common element that we 02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0% 02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.790 align:start position:0% have you know silicon that on the on the 02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0% 02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.390 align:start position:0% earth's crust they could be made of 02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0% 02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.669 align:start position:0% diamond or something then we would have 02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0% 02:07:21.679 --> 02:07:24.229 align:start position:0% only had one computer yeah right so it's 02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0% 02:07:24.239 --> 02:07:25.510 align:start position:0% a lot of things are kind of slightly 02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0% 02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.589 align:start position:0% suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds 02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0% 02:07:27.599 --> 02:07:29.510 align:start position:0% this puzzle sure sounds like something 02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0% 02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.589 align:start position:0% we talked about earlier what it takes to 02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0% 02:07:31.599 --> 02:07:33.750 align:start position:0% to design a game 02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0% 02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.510 align:start position:0% that's really fun to play for prolonged 02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0% 02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.589 align:start position:0% periods of time 02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0% 02:07:37.599 --> 02:07:39.510 align:start position:0% and it does seem like this puzzle like 02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0% 02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.669 align:start position:0% you mentioned the more you learn about 02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0% 02:07:41.679 --> 02:07:43.830 align:start position:0% it the more you realize how little you 02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0% 02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.790 align:start position:0% 02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0% 02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:47.030 align:start position:0% so it humbles you but excites you by the 02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0% 02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.430 align:start position:0% possibility of learning more it's one 02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0% 02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.830 align:start position:0% heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got 02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0% 02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.950 align:start position:0% going on here um so like i mentioned of 02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0% 02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:57.030 align:start position:0% all the people in the world you're very 02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0% 02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:00.550 align:start position:0% likely to be the one who creates the agi 02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0% 02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:01.910 align:start position:0% 02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0% 02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.229 align:start position:0% um that achieves human level 02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0% 02:08:04.239 --> 02:08:06.390 align:start position:0% intelligence and goes beyond it so if 02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0% 02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.629 align:start position:0% you got a chance and very well you could 02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0% 02:08:08.639 --> 02:08:10.149 align:start position:0% be the person that goes into the room 02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0% 02:08:10.159 --> 02:08:12.950 align:start position:0% with the system and have a conversation 02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0% 02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.189 align:start position:0% maybe you only get to ask one question 02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0% 02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:16.470 align:start position:0% if you do 02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0% 02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:19.270 align:start position:0% what question would you ask her 02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0% 02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:22.069 align:start position:0% i would probably ask um what is the true 02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0% 02:08:22.079 --> 02:08:23.510 align:start position:0% nature of reality 02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0% 02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.629 align:start position:0% i think that's the question i don't know 02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0% 02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:25.990 align:start position:0% if i'd understand the answer because 02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0% 02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.750 align:start position:0% maybe it would be 42 or something like 02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0% 02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:30.470 align:start position:0% that but um that's the question i would 02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0% 02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.310 align:start position:0% ask 02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0% 02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:34.069 align:start position:0% and then there'll be a deep sigh from 02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0% 02:08:34.079 --> 02:08:35.510 align:start position:0% the systems like all right how do i 02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0% 02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.430 align:start position:0% explain to the excuse me exactly all 02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0% 02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:40.390 align:start position:0% right let me i don't have time 02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0% 02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.629 align:start position:0% to explain uh maybe i'll draw you a 02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0% 02:08:42.639 --> 02:08:44.550 align:start position:0% picture that it is 02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0% 02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.109 align:start position:0% i mean how do you even begin 02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0% 02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:48.229 align:start position:0% 02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0% 02:08:48.239 --> 02:08:51.109 align:start position:0% to answer that question 02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0% 02:08:51.119 --> 02:08:53.109 align:start position:0% well i think it would um what would you 02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0% 02:08:53.119 --> 02:08:54.310 align:start position:0% what would you think the answer could 02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0% 02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:56.709 align:start position:0% possibly look like i think it could it 02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0% 02:08:56.719 --> 02:08:58.550 align:start position:0% could start looking like 02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0% 02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:59.350 align:start position:0% 02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0% 02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.510 align:start position:0% uh more fundamental explanations of 02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0% 02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:03.830 align:start position:0% physics would be the beginning you know 02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0% 02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.669 align:start position:0% more careful specification of that 02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0% 02:09:05.679 --> 02:09:07.270 align:start position:0% taking you walking us through by the 02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0% 02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.430 align:start position:0% hand as to what one would do to maybe 02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0% 02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.350 align:start position:0% prove those things out maybe giving you 02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0% 02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:13.030 align:start position:0% glimpses of 02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0% 02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:14.790 align:start position:0% what things you totally missed in the 02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0% 02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:16.149 align:start position:0% physics of today 02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0% 02:09:16.159 --> 02:09:19.109 align:start position:0% exactly just here here's glimpses of no 02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0% 02:09:19.119 --> 02:09:20.950 align:start position:0% like there's a much 02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0% 02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.069 align:start position:0% 02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0% 02:09:22.079 --> 02:09:23.910 align:start position:0% a much more elaborate world or a much 02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0% 02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:26.629 align:start position:0% simpler world or something 02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0% 02:09:26.639 --> 02:09:29.109 align:start position:0% a much deeper maybe simpler explanation 02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0% 02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:31.030 align:start position:0% yes of things right than the standard 02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0% 02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:32.709 align:start position:0% model of physics which we know doesn't 02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0% 02:09:32.719 --> 02:09:36.149 align:start position:0% work but we still keep adding to so um 02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0% 02:09:36.159 --> 02:09:37.750 align:start position:0% and and that's how i think the beginning 02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0% 02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.030 align:start position:0% of an explanation would look and it 02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0% 02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.629 align:start position:0% would start encompassing many of the 02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0% 02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:42.229 align:start position:0% mysteries that we have wondered about 02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0% 02:09:42.239 --> 02:09:44.229 align:start position:0% for thousands of years like you know 02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:44.239 align:start position:0% 02:09:44.239 --> 02:09:45.750 align:start position:0% consciousness 02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0% 02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:48.709 align:start position:0% uh life and gravity all of these things 02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0% 02:09:48.719 --> 02:09:50.310 align:start position:0% yeah giving us a glimpses of 02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0% 02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.470 align:start position:0% explanations for those things yeah 02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0% 02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.910 align:start position:0% well um 02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0% 02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:56.390 align:start position:0% damas dear one of the special 02:09:56.390 -->
